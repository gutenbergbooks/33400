<h2>THE BOOK OF SUSAN</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE FIRST CHAPTER</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<div class='cap'>IT happens that I twice saw Susan's mother, one of those
soiled rags of humanity used by careless husbands for
wiping their boots; but Susan does not remember her.
John Stuart Mill studied Greek at three, and there is
a Russian author who recalls being weaned as the first of
his many bitter experiences. Either Susan's mental life
did not waken so early or the record has faded. She remembers
only the consolate husband, her father; remembers
him only too well. The backs of his square, angry-looking
hands were covered with an unpleasant growth
of reddish bristles; his nostrils were hairy, too, and seemed
formed by Nature solely for the purpose of snorting with
wrath. It must not be held against Susan that she never
loved her father; he was not created to inspire the softer
emotions. Nor am I altogether certain just why he was
created at all.</div>

<p>Nevertheless, Robert Blake was in his soberer hours&mdash;say,
from Tuesdays to Fridays&mdash;an expert mechanic, thoroughly
conversant with the interior lack of economy of
most makes of automobiles. He had charge of the repair
department of the Eureka Garage, New Haven, where my
not-too-robust touring car of those primitive days spent,
during the spring of 1907, many weeks of interesting and
expensive invalidism. I forget how many major operations
it underwent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not at the Eureka Garage, however, that I first
met Bob Blake. Nine years before I there found him
again, I had defended him in court&mdash;as it happens, successfully&mdash;on
a charge of assault with intent to kill. That
was almost my first case, and not far&mdash;thank heaven&mdash;from
my last. Bob's defense, I remember, was assigned
to me by a judge who had once borrowed fifty dollars
from my father, which he never repaid; at least, not in
cash. There are more convenient methods. True, my
father was no longer living at the time I was appointed
to defend Bob; but that is a detail.</p>

<p>Susan was then four years old. I can't say I recall her,
if I even laid eyes on her. But Mrs. Bob appeared as a
witness, at my request&mdash;it was all but her final appearance,
poor woman; she died of an embolism within a
week&mdash;and I remember she told the court that a kinder
husband and father than Bob had never existed. I remember,
too, that the court pursed its lips and the gentlemen
of the jury grinned approvingly, for Mrs. Bob
could not easily conceal something very like the remains
of a purple eye, which she attributed to hearing a suspicious
noise one night down cellar, a sort of squeaking
noise, and to falling over the cat on her tour of investigation&mdash;with
various circumstantial <i>minuti&aelig;</i> of no present
importance.</p>

<p>The important thing is, that Bob went scot-free and
was as nearly grateful as his temperament permitted.
His assault&mdash;with an umbrella stand&mdash;had been upon a
fellow reveller of no proved worth to the community, and
perhaps this may have influenced the jury's unexpected
verdict.</p>

<p>Of Susan herself my first impression was gained at the
Eureka Garage. Bob Blake, just then, was lying beneath
my car, near which I hovered listening to his
voluble but stereotyped profanity. He had lost the nut
from a bolt, and, unduly constricted, sought it vainly,
while his tongue followed the line of least resistance. I
was marveling at the energy of his wrath and the poverty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of his imagination, when I became aware of a small being
beside me, in plaid calico. She had eager black eyes&mdash;terrier's
eyes&mdash;in a white, whimsical little face. One very
long and very thin black pigtail dangled over her left
shoulder and down across her flat chest to her waist,
where it was tied with a shoe string and ended lankly,
without even the semblance of a curl. In her right hand
she bore a full dinner pail, and with her left thumb
she pointed toward the surging darkness beneath my
car.</p>

<p>"Say, mister, please," said the small being, "if I was to
put this down, would you mind telling him his dinner's
come?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit," I responded. "Are you Bob's youngster?"</p>

<p>"I'm Susan Blake," she answered; and very softly
placed the dinner pail on the step of the car.</p>

<p>"Why don't you wait and see your father?" I suggested.
"He'll come up for air in a minute."</p>

<p>"That's why I'm going now," said Susan.</p>

<p>Whereupon she gave a single half skip&mdash;the very ghost
of a skip&mdash;then walked demurely from me and out through
the great door.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Bob Blake, in those days, lived in a somewhat dilapidated
four-room house, off toward the wrong end of Birch
Street. His family arrangements were peculiar. He had
never married again; but not very long after his wife's
death a dull-eyed, rather mussy young woman, with a
fondness for rouge pots, had taken up her abode with
him&mdash;to the scandal and fascination of the neighborhood.
It was an outrage, of course! With a child in the house,
too! Something ought to be done about it!</p>

<p>Yet, oddly enough, nothing that much worried Bob ever
was done about it, reckoning the various shocked-and-grieved
forms of conversation as nothing. As he never
tired of asserting, Bob didn't give a damn for the cackle
of a lot of hens. He guessed he knew his way about;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and so did Pearl. Let the damned hens cackle their heads
off; he was satisfied!</p>

<p>And so, eventually, I am forced to believe, were the
hens. In the earlier days of the scandal there was much
clitter-clatter of having the law on him, serving papers,
and the like; but, as hen cackle sometimes will, it came
to precisely naught. Nor am I certain that, as the years
passed, the neighborhood did not grow a little proud of
its one crimson patch of wickedness; I am reasonably certain,
indeed, that more than one drab life took on a little
borrowed flush of excitement from its proximity.</p>

<p>Of course no decent, God-fearing woman would ever
greet either Bob or Pearl; but every time one passed
either of them without a nod or a "How's things to-day?"
it gave one something to talk about, at home, or over
any amicable fence.</p>

<p>As for the men, they too were forbidden to speak; but
men, most of them, are unruly creatures if at large. You
can't trust them safely five minutes beyond the sound of
your voice.</p>

<p>There was even one man, old Heinze, proprietor of the
Birch Street grocery store, who now and then cautiously
put forth a revolutionary sentiment.</p>

<p>"Dey lifs alvays togedder&mdash;like man unt vife&mdash;nod?
Vere iss der diffurunz, Mrs. Shay?"</p>

<p>"Shame on you for <i>them</i> words, Mr. Heinze!"</p>

<p>"<i>Aber</i>"&mdash;with a slow, wide smile&mdash;"vere iss der diffurunz,
Mrs. Shay? I leaf id to you?"</p>

<p>That Pearl and Bob lived always together cannot be
denied, and perhaps they also lived as some men and their
lawful wives are accustomed to live&mdash;off toward the wrong
end of city streets; and occasionally, no doubt, toward
the right end of them as well. Midweek, things wore
along dully enough, but over Sunday came drink and
ructions. Susan says she has never been able to understand
why Sunday happens to be called a day of
rest. The day of arrest, she was once guilty of naming
it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob's neighbors, I fear, were not half so scandalized
by his week-end drunkenness as by what Mrs. Perkins&mdash;three
doors nearer the right end of Birch Street&mdash;invariably
called his "brazen immorality." Intoxication
was not a rare vice in that miscellaneous block or two of
factory operatives. Nor can it be said that immorality,
in the sense of Mrs. Perkins, was so much rare as it was
nervously concealed. The unique quality of Bob's sin lay
in its brazen element; that was what stamped him peculiarly
as a social outlaw.</p>

<p>Bob accepted this position, if sober, with a grim disregard.
He had a bitter, lowering nature at best, and when
not profane was taciturn. As for Pearl, social outlawry
may be said to have been her native element. She had a
hazy mind in a lazy body, and liked better than most
things just to sit in a rocking-chair and polish her finger
nails, as distinguished from cleaning them. Only the
guiltless member of this family group really suffered
from its low social estate, but she suffered acutely. Little
Susan could not abide being a social outlaw.</p>

<p>True, she was not always included in the general condemnation
of her family by the grown-ups; but the children
were ruthless. They pointed fingers, and there was
much conscious giggling behind her back; while some of
the daintier little girls&mdash;the very little girls whom Susan
particularly longed to chum with&mdash;had been forbidden to
play with "that child," and were not at all averse to telling
her so, flatly, with tiny chins in air and a devastating
expression of rectitude on their smug little faces. At
such times Susan would fight back impending cataracts,
stick her own freckled nose toward the firmament, and
even, I regret to say, if persistently harassed, thrust forth
a rigid pink tongue. This, Susan has since informed me,
is the embryonic state of "swearing like anything."</p>

<p>The little boys, on the whole, were better. They often
said cruel things, but Susan felt that they said them in a
quite different spirit from their instinctively snobbish and
Grundyish sisters&mdash;said them merely by way of bravado,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
or just for the fun of seeing whether or not she would cry.
And then they often let her join in their games, and on
those happy occasions treated her quite as an equal, with
an impartial and, to Susan, entirely blissful roughness.
Susan early decided that she liked boys much better than
girls.</p>

<p>There was, for example, Jimmy Kane, whose widowed
mother took in washing, and so never had any time to
clean up her huddled flat, over Heinze's grocery store, or
her family of four&mdash;two boys and two girls. No one ever
saw skin, as in itself it really is, on the faces of Mrs.
Kane's children, and Jimmy was always, if comparison be
possible, the grimiest of the brood. For some reason
Jimmy always had a perpetual slight cold, and his funny
flat button of a nose wept, winter and summer alike,
though never into an unnecessary handkerchief. His
coat-sleeve served, even if its ministrations did not add
to the tidiness of his countenance.</p>

<p>Susan often wished she might scrub him, just to see
what he really looked like; for she idolized Jimmy. Not
that Jimmy ever had paid any special attention to her,
except on one occasion. It was merely that he accepted
her as part of the human scheme of things, which in itself
would almost have been enough to win Susan's affectionate
admiration. But one day, as I have hinted, he became the
god of her idolatry.</p>

<p>The incident is not precisely idyllic. A certain Joe&mdash;Giuseppe
Gonfarone; <i>&aelig;tat.</i> 14&mdash;whose father peddled
fruit and vegetables, had recently come into the neighborhood;
a black-curled, brown-eyed little devil, already far
too wise in the manifold unseemliness of this sad old
planet. Joe was strong, stocky, aggressive, and soon posed
as something of a bully among the younger boys along
Birch Street. Within less than a month he had infected
the minds of many with a new and rich vocabulary of
oaths and smutty words. Joe was not of the unconsciously
foul-mouthed; he relished his depravity. In fact,
youngster as he was, Joe had in him the makings of that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
slimiest product of our cities&mdash;the street pimp, or cadet.</p>

<p>It was one fine spring day, three years or so before I met
Susan in the Eureka Garage, that Joe, with a group of
Birch Street boys, was playing marbles for keeps, just at
the bottom of the long incline which carries Birch Street
down to the swamp land and general dump at the base
of East Rock. Susan was returning home from Orange
Street, after bearing her father his full dinner pail, and
as she came up to the boys she halted on one foot, using
the toe of her free foot meanwhile to scratch mosquito
bites upward along her supporting shin.</p>

<p>"H'lo, Susan!" called Jimmy Kane, with his perfunctory
good nature. "What's bitin' you?"</p>

<p>Then it was his turn to knuckle-down. Susan, still
balanced cranelike, watched him eager-eyed, and was so
delighted when he knocked a fine fat reeler of Joe's out
of the ring, jumping up with a yell of triumph to pocket
it, that she too gave a shrill cheer: "Oh, goody! I knew
you'd win!"</p>

<p>The note of ecstasy in her tone infuriated Joe. "Say!"
he shrieked. "You getta hell outta here!"</p>

<p>Susan's smile vanished; her white, even teeth&mdash;she had
all her front ones, she tells me; she was ten&mdash;clicked
audibly together.</p>

<p>"It's no business of yours!" she retorted.</p>

<p>"You're right; it ain't!" This from Jimmy, still in
high good humor. "You stay here if you want. You're
as good as him!"</p>

<p>"Who's as good as me?"</p>

<p>"She is!"</p>

<p>"<i>Her?</i>" Joe's lips curled back. He turned to the other
boys, who had all scrambled to their feet by this time
and, instinctively scenting mischief, were standing in a
sort of ring. "He says she's good as me!"</p>

<p>Two of the smallest boys tittered, from pure excitement.
Susan's nose went up.</p>

<p>"I'm better. I'm not a dago!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Joe leaped toward Susan and thrust his dense, bull-like
head forward, till his eyes were glaring into hers.</p>

<p>"Mebbe I live lika you&mdash;eh? Mebbe I live," cried Joe,
"with a dirty <i>whore!</i>"</p>

<p>There was a gasp from the encircling boys as Susan
fell back from this word, which she did not wholly comprehend,
but whose vileness she felt, somehow, in her very
flesh. Joe, baring gorilla teeth, burst into coarse jubilation.</p>

<p>It was just at this point that Jimmy Kane, younger
than Joe by a year or more, and far slighter, jumped
on the little ruffian&mdash;alas, from behind!&mdash;and dealt him as
powerful a blow on the head as he could compass; a blow
whose effectiveness, I reluctantly admit, was enhanced
by the half brick with which Jimmy had first of all prudently
provided himself. Joe Gonfarone went to earth,
inert, but bleeding profusely.</p>

<p>There was a scuttling of frightened feet in every direction.
Susan herself did not stop running until she reached
the very top of the Birch Street incline. Then she looked
back, her eyes lambent, her heart throbbing, not alone
from the rapid ascent. Yes, there was Jimmy&mdash;<i>her</i>
Jimmy!&mdash;kneeling in the dust by the still prostrate Joe.
Susan could not hear him, but she knew somehow from
his attitude that he was scared to death, and that he was
asking Joe if he was hurt much. She agonized with her
champion, feeling none the less proud of him, and she
waited for him at the top of the rise, hoping to thank
him, longing to kiss his hands.</p>

<p>But Jimmy, when he did pass her, went by without a
glance, at top speed. He was bound for a doctor. So
Susan never really managed to thank Jimmy at all. She
merely idolized him in secret, a process which proved,
however, fairly heart-warming and, in the main, satisfactory.</p>

<p>It took three stitches to mend Joe's head&mdash;a fact famous
in the junior annals of Birch Street for some years&mdash;and
soon after he appeared, somewhat broken in spirit,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
in the street again, his parents moved him, Margharita
and the sloe-eyed twins to Bridgeport&mdash;very much, be it
admitted, to the relief of Jimmy Kane, who had lived for
three weeks nursing a lonely fear of dark reprisals.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>There was one thing about Bob Blake's four-room house&mdash;it
exactly fitted his family. The floor plan was simple
and economically efficient. Between the monolithic door
slab&mdash;relic of a time when Bob's house had been frankly
"in the country"&mdash;and the public street lay a walk
formed of a single plank supported on chance-set bricks.
From the door slab one stepped through the front doorway
directly into the parlor. Beyond the parlor lay the
kitchen, from which one could pass out through a narrow
door to a patch of weed-grown back yard. A ladderlike
stair led up from one side of the kitchen, opposite to the
single window and the small coal range. At the top of
the stair was a slit of unlighted hallway with a door near
either end of it. The door toward Birch Street gave
upon the bedroom occupied by Bob and Pearl; the rearward
door led to Susan's sternly ascetic cubiculum. No
one of these four rooms could be described as spacious,
but the parlor and Bob's bedroom may have been twelve
by fifteen or thereabouts. Susan's quarters were a scant
ten by ten.</p>

<p>The solider and more useful pieces of furniture in the
house belonged to the r&eacute;gime of Susan's mother&mdash;the great
black-walnut bed which almost filled the front bedroom;
Susan's single iron cot frame; the parlor table with its
marble top; the melodeon; the kitchen range; and the
deal table in the kitchen, upon which, impartially, food
was prepared and meals were served. To these respectable
properties Pearl had added from time to time certain
other objects of interest or art.</p>

<p>Thus, in the parlor, there was a cane rocking-chair,
gilded; and on the wall above the melodeon hung a banjo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
suspended from a nail by a broad sash of soiled blue ribbon.
On the drumhead of the banjo someone had painted
a bunch of nondescript flowers, and Pearl always claimed
these as her own handiwork, wrought in happier days.
This was her one eagerly contested point of pride; for Bob,
when in liquor, invariably denied the possibility of her
ever having painted "that there bouquet." This flat
denial was always the starting point for those more violent
Sunday-night quarrels, which had done so much to
reduce the furniture of the house to its stouter, more imperishable
elements.</p>

<p>During the brief interval between the death of Susan's
mother and the arrival of Pearl, Bob had placed his domestic
affairs in the hands of an old negro-woman, who
came in during the day to clean up, keep an eye on
Susan and prepare Bob's dinner. Most of the hours
during Bob's absence this poor old creature spent in a
rocking-chair, nodding in and out of sleep; and it was
rather baby Susan, sprawling about the kitchen floor,
who kept an eye on her, than the reverse. Pearl's installation
had changed all that. Bob naturally expected
any woman he chose to support to work for her board and
lodging; and it may be that at first Pearl had been too
grateful for any shelter to risk jeopardizing her good luck
by shirking. There seems to be no doubt that for a while
she did her poor utmost to keep house&mdash;but the sloven
in her was too deeply rooted not to flower.</p>

<p>By the time Susan was six or seven the interior condition
of Bob's house was too crawlingly unpleasant to bear
exact description; and even Bob, though callous enough in
such matters, began to have serious thoughts of giving
Pearl the slip&mdash;not to mention his landlord&mdash;and of running
off with Susan to some other city, where he could
make a fresh start and perhaps contrive now and then to
get something decent to eat set before him. It never occurred
to him to give Susan the slip as well&mdash;which would
have freed his hands; not because he had a soft spot somewhere
for the child, nor because he felt toward her any special<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
sense of moral obligation. Simply, it never occurred to
him. Susan was his kid; and if he went she went with
him, along with his pipe, his shop tools, and his set of
six English razors&mdash;his dearest possession, of which he was
jealously and irascibly proud.</p>

<p>But, as it happens, Bob never acted upon this slowly
forming desire to escape; the desire was quietly checked
and insensibly receded; and for this Susan herself was
directly responsible.</p>

<p>Very early in life she began to supplement Pearl's feeble
housewifery, but it was not until her ninth year that
Susan decided to bring about a domestic revolution.
Whether or no hatred of dirt be inheritable, I leave to
biologists, merely thumbnailing two facts for their consideration:
Susan's mother had hated dirt with an unappeasable
hatred; her nightly, after-supper, insensate pursuit
of imaginary cobwebs had been one of Bob's choicest
grievances against her. And little Susan hated dirt, in
all its forms, with an almost equal venom, but with a
brain at once more active and more unreeling. She had
good reason to hate it. She must either have hated it or
been subdued to it. For five years, more or less, she had
lived in the midst of dirt and suffered. It had seemed
to her one of the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'inexpugnable'">inexpungable</ins> evils of existence, like
mosquitoes, or her father's temper, or the smell of Pearl's
cheap talcum powder when warmed by the fumes of cooking
cabbage. But gradually it came upon her that dirt
only accumulated in the absence of a will to removal.</p>

<p>Once her outreaching mind had grasped&mdash;without wordily
formulating&mdash;this physical and moral law, her course
was plain. Since the will to removal was dormant or missing
in Pearl, she must supply it. Within the scope of her
childish strength, she did supply it. Susan insists that it
took her two years merely to overcome the handicap of
Pearl's neglect. Her self-taught technique was faulty;
proper tools were lacking. There was a bucket which,
when filled, she could not lift; a broom that tripped her;
high corners she could not reach&mdash;corners she had to grow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
up to, even with the aid of a chair. But in the end she
triumphed. By the time she was thirteen&mdash;she was thirteen
when I first saw in the Eureka Garage&mdash;Bob's four rooms
were spotless six and one-half days out of every seven.</p>

<p>Even Pearl, in her flaccid way, approved the change.
"It beats hell," she remarked affably to Bob one night,
"how that ugly little monkey likes to scrub things. She's
a real help to me, that child is. But no comp'ny. And
she's a sight."</p>

<p>"Well," growled Bob, "she comes by that honest. So
was the old woman." They were annoyed when Susan,
sitting by them, for the first time within their memory
burst into flooding, uncontrollable tears.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>I should probably, in my own flaccid way, have lost all
track of Susan, if it had not been for certain ugly things
that befell in Bob's four-room house one breathless evening&mdash;June
twentieth of the year 1907. It is a date stamped
into my consciousness like a notarial seal. For one thing
it happened to be my birthday&mdash;my thirty-third, which I
was not precisely celebrating, since it was also the anniversary
of the day my wife had left me, two years before.
Nor was I entirely pleased to have become, suddenly,
thirty-three. I counted it the threshold of middle-age.
Now that eleven years have passed, and with them my
health and the world's futile pretense at peace, I am
feeling younger.</p>

<p>This book is about Susan, but it will be simpler if you
know something, too, concerning her scribe. Fortunately
there is not much that it will be needful to tell.</p>

<p>I was&mdash;in those bad, grossly comfortable old days&mdash;that
least happy of Nature's experiments, a man whose inherited
income permitted him to be an idler, and whose
tastes urged him to write precious little essays about
precious little for the more precious reviews. My half-hearted
attempt to practice law I had long abandoned. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
lived in a commodious, inherited mansion on Hillhouse
Avenue&mdash;an avenue which in all fairness must be called
aristocratic, since it has no wrong end to it. It is right at
both ends, so, naturally, though broad, it is not very long.
My grandfather, toward the end of a profitably ill-spent
life, built this mansion of sad-colored stone in a somewhat
mixed Italian style; my father filled it with expensive
and unsightly movables&mdash;the spoils of a grand European
tour; and I, in my turn, had emptied it of these
treasures and refilled it with my own carefully chosen
collection of rare furniture, rare Oriental carpets, rare
first editions, and costly <i>objets d'art</i>. This collection I
then anxiously believed, and do still in part believe, to
be beautiful&mdash;though I am no longer haunted by an earlier
fear lest the next generation should repudiate my taste
and reverse my opinion. Let the auction rooms of 1960
decide. Neither in flesh nor in spirit shall I attend them.</p>

<p>The tragi-comedy of my luckless marriage I shall not
stop here to explain, but its rather mysterious ending
had at first largely cut me off from my old family friends
and my socially correct acquaintances. When Gertrude
left me, their sympathies, or their sense of security, went
with her. I can hardly blame them. There had been no
glaring scandal, but the fault was inferentially mine. To
speak quite brutally, I did not altogether regret their loss.
Too many of them had bored me for too many years. I
was glad to rely more on the companionship of certain
writers and painters which my scribbling had quietly
won for me, here and in France. I traveled about a good
deal. When at home, I kept my guest rooms filled&mdash;often,
in the horrid phrase, with "visitors of distinction."</p>

<p>In this way I became a social problem, locally, of some
magnitude. Visitors of distinction&mdash;even when of eccentric
distinction&mdash;cannot easily be ignored in a university
town. Thus it made it a little awkward, perhaps, that I
should so often prove to be their host; a little&mdash;less, on the
whole, than one would suppose. Within two years&mdash;just
following Ballou's brief stay with me, on his way to introduce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
that now forgotten nine-days wonder, Polymorphous
Prose, among initiates of the Plymouth Rock Poetry
Guild, at Boston&mdash;my slight remaining ineligibility was
tacitly and finally ignored. The old family friends began
to hint that Gertrude, though a splendid woman, had always
been a little austere. Possibly there were faults on
both sides. One never knew.</p>

<p>And it was just at this hour of social re&euml;stablishment
that my birthday swung round again, for the thirty-third
time, and brought with it a change in my outer life which
was to lead on to even greater changes in all my modes
of thinking and feeling. Odd, that a drunken quarrel
in a four-room house toward the wrong end of Birch
Street could so affect the destiny of a luxurious <i>dilettante</i>,
living at the very center of bonded respectability, in a
mansion of sad-colored stone, on a short broad avenue
which is right at both ends!</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>"Never in this (obviously outcast) world!" grumbled
Bob Blake, bringing his malletlike fist down on the marble
top of the parlor table.</p>

<p>The blow made his half-filled glass jump and clinkle;
so he emptied it slowly, then poured in four fingers more,
forgetting to add water this time, and sullenly pushed
the bottle across to Pearl. But Pearl was fretful. Her
watery blue eyes were fixed upon the drumhead of the
banjo, where it hung suspended above the melodeon.</p>

<p>"I did so paint them flowers. And well you know it.
What's the good of bein' so mean? If you wasn't heeled
you'd let me have it my way. Didn't I bring that banjo
with me?"</p>

<p>"Hungh! Say you did. What does that prove?"</p>

<p>"I guess it proves somethin', all right."</p>

<p>"Proves you swiped it, likely."</p>

<p>"Me! I ain't that kind, thanks."</p>

<p>"The hell you ain't."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you're tryin' to get gay, cut it out!"</p>

<p>"Not me."</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;quit!"</p>

<p>This was shortly after supper. It was an unusually
hot, humid evening; doors and windows stood open to no
purpose; and Susan was sitting out on the monolithic
door slab, fighting off mosquitoes. She found that this
defensive warfare partly distracted her from the witless,
interminable bickering within. Moreover, the striated
effluvia of whisky, talcum powder, and perspiration had
made her head feel a little queer. By comparison, the
fetid breath from the exposed mud banks of the salt marsh
was almost refreshing.</p>

<p>Possibly it was because her head did feel a little queer
that Susan began presently to wonder about things. Between
her days at the neighboring public school and her
voluntary rounds of housework, Susan had not of late
years had much waking time to herself. In younger and
less crowded hours, before her father had been informed
by the authorities that he must either send his child to
school or take the consequences, Susan had put in all
her spare moments at wondering. She would see a toad
in the back yard, for example, under a plantain leaf, and
she would begin to wonder. She would wonder what it felt
like to be a toad. And before very long something would
happen to her, inside, and she would <i>be</i> a toad. She would
have toad thoughts and toad feelings.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There would
stretch above her a dim, green, balancing canopy&mdash;the
plantain leaf. All about her were soaring, translucent
fronds&mdash;the grass. It was cool there under the plantain
leaf; but she was enormously fat and ugly, her brain
felt like sooty cobwebs, and nobody loved her.</p>

<p>Still, she didn't care much. She could feel her soft
gray throat, like a blown-into glove finger, pulsing slowly&mdash;which
was almost as soothing a sensation as letting the
swing die down. It made her feel as if Someone&mdash;some
great unhappy cloudlike Being&mdash;were making up a song,
a song about most everything; chanting it sleepily to himself&mdash;or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
was it <i>herself?</i>&mdash;somewhere; and as if she were
part of this beautiful, unhappy song. But all the time
she knew that if that white fluffy restlessness&mdash;that moth
miller&mdash;fluttered only a little nearer among those golden-green
fronds, she knew if it reached the cool rim of her
plantain shade, she knew, then, that something terrible
would happen to her&mdash;knew that something swift and
blind, that she couldn't help, would coil deep within her
like a spring and so launch her forward, open-jawed. It
was awful&mdash;awful for the moth miller&mdash;but she couldn't
<i>not</i> do it. She was a toad.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>And it was the same with her father. There were
things he couldn't not do. She could be&mdash;sitting very
still in a corner&mdash;<i>be</i> her father, when he was angry; and
she knew he couldn't help it. It was just a dark slow
whirling inside, with red sparks flying swiftly out from it.
And it hurt while it lasted. Being her father like that
always made her sorry for him. But she wished, and she
felt he must often wish, that he couldn't be at all. There
were lots of live things that would be happier if they
weren't live things; and <i>if</i> they weren't, Susan felt, the
great cloudlike Being would be less unhappy too.</p>

<p>Naturally, I am giving you Susan's later interpretations
of her pre-schoolday wonderings; and a number of
you would gasp a little, knowing what firm, delicate imaginings
all Susan Blake's later interpretations were, if
I should give you her pen name as well&mdash;which I have
promised myself not to do. This is not an official study
of a young writer of peculiar distinction; it is merely
an unpretending book about a little girl I knew and a
young married woman I still know&mdash;one and the same
person. It is what I have named it&mdash;that only: <i>The
Book of Susan</i>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, this humid June night&mdash;to the sordid accompaniment
of Bob and Pearl snarling at each other
half-drunkenly within&mdash;Susan waits for us on the monolithic
door slab; and there is a new wonder in her dizzy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
little head. I can't do better than let her tell you in her
own words what this new wonder was like.</p>

<p>"Ambo, dear"&mdash;my name, by the way, is Ambrose
Hunt; Captain Hunt, of the American Red Cross, at
the present writing, which I could date from a sleepy little
village in Southern France&mdash;"Ambo, dear, it was the
moon, mostly. There was a pink bud of light in the heat
mist, way off beyond East Rock, and then the great wild
rose of the moon opened slowly through it. Papa, inside,
was sounding just like a dog when he's bullying another
dog, walking up on the points of his toes, stiff legged,
round him. So I tried to escape, tried to be the moon;
tried to feel floaty and shining and beautiful, and&mdash;and
remote. But I couldn't manage it. I never could make
myself be anything not alive. I've tried to be stones, but
it's no good. It won't work. I can be trees&mdash;a little. But
usually I have to be animals, or men and women&mdash;and of
course they're animals too.</p>

<p>"So I began wondering why I liked the moon, why just
looking at it made me feel happy. It couldn't talk to
me; or love me. All it could do was to be up there, sometimes,
and shine. Then I remembered about mythology.
Miss Chisholm, in school, was always telling us about gods
and goddesses. She said we were children, so we could
recreate the gods for ourselves, because they belonged to
the child age of the world. She talked like that a lot, in a
faded-leaf voice, and none of us ever understood her. The
truth is, Ambo, we never paid any attention to her; she
smiled too much and too sadly, without meaning it; and
her eyelashes were white. All the same, that night somehow
I remembered Artemis, the virgin moon goddess, who
slipped silently through dark woods at dusk, hunting with
a silvery bow. Being a virgin seemed to mean that you
didn't care much for boys. But I did always like boys
better than girls, so I decided I could never be a virgin.
And yet I loved the thought of Artemis from that moment.
I began to think about her&mdash;oh, intensely!&mdash;always
keeping off by herself; cool, and shining, and&mdash;and detached.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
And there was one boy she <i>had</i> cared for; I remembered
that, too, though I couldn't remember his name.
A naked, brown sort of boy, who kept off by himself on
blue, distant hills. So Artemis wasn't really a virgin at
all. She was just&mdash;awfully particular. She liked clean,
open places, and the winds, and clear, swift water. What
she hated most was <i>stuffiness!</i> That's why I decided then
and there, Ambo, that Artemis should be my goddess, my
own pet goddess; and I made up a prayer to her. I've
never forgotten it. I often say it still.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<div class='poem'>
<i>Dearest, dearest Far-Away,</i><br />
<i>Can you hear me when I pray?</i><br />
<i>Can you hear me when I cry?</i><br />
<i>Would you care if I should die?</i><br />
<i>No, you wouldn't care at all;</i><br />
<i>But I love you most of all.</i><br />
</div>

<p>"It isn't very good, Ambo, but it's the first rhyme I
ever made up out of my own head. And I just talked
it right off to Artemis without any trouble. But I had
hardly finished it, when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>What had happened next was the crash of glassware,
followed by Bob's thick voice, bellowing: "C'm ba' here!
Damned slut! Tell yeh t' c'm ba' an'&mdash;an' 'pol'gize!"</p>

<p>Susan heard a strangling screech from Pearl, the jar
of a heavy piece of furniture overturned. The child's
first impulse was to run out into Birch Street and scream
for help. She tells me her spine knew all at once that
something terrible had happened&mdash;or was going to happen.
Then, in an odd flash of hallucination, she saw
<i>Artemis</i> poised the fleetingest second before her&mdash;beautiful,
a little disdainful, divinely unafraid. So Susan
gulped, dug her nails fiercely into her palms, and hurried
back through the parlor into the kitchen, where she stumbled
across the overturned table and fell, badly bruising
her cheek.</p>

<p>As she scrambled to her feet a door slammed to, above.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Her father, in a grotesque crouching posture, was mounting
the ladderlike stair. On the floor at the stair's foot
lay the parchment head of Pearl's banjo, which he had cut
from its frame. Susan distinctly caught the smudged
pinks and blues of the nondescript flowers. She realized
at once that her father was bound on no good errand.
And Pearl was trapped. Susan called to her father,
daringly, a little wildly. He slued round to her, leaning
heavily on the stair rail, his face green-white, his lips held
back by some evil reflex in a fixed, appalling grin.</p>

<p>It was the face of a madman.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He raised his right
hand, slowly, and a tiny prismatic gleam darted from the
blade of an opened razor&mdash;one of his precious set of six.
He had evidently used it to destroy the banjo head, which
he would never have done in his right mind. But now
he made a shocking gesture with the blade, significant
of other uses; then turned, crouching once more, to continue
upward. Susan tried to cry out, tried to follow him,
until the room slid from its moorings into a whirlpool of
humming blackness.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>That is all Susan remembers for some time. It is just
as well.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>What Susan next recalls is an intense blare of light,
rousing her from her nothingness, like trumpets. Her
immediate confused notion was that the gates of hell had
been flung wide for her; and when a tall black figure presently
cut across the merciless rays and towered before
her, she thought it must be the devil. But the intense
blare came from the head lights of my touring car, and
the tall black devil was I. A greatly puzzled and compassionate
devil I was too! Maltby Phar&mdash;that exquisite
anarchist&mdash;was staying with me, and we had run down
to the shore for dinner, hoping to mitigate the heat by the
ride, and my new sensation of frustrate middle-age by
broiled live lobsters. It was past eleven. I had just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
dropped Maltby at the house and had run my car round
to the garage where Bob worked, meaning to leave it
there overnight so Bob could begin patching at it the
first thing in the morning. It had been bucking its way
along on three cylinders or less all day.</p>

<p>Bob's garage lay back from the street down a narrow
alley. Judge, then, of my astonishment as I nosed my car
up to its shut double doors! There, on the concrete incline
before the doors, lay a small crumpled figure, half-curled,
like an unearthed cut-worm, about a shining dinner pail.
I brought the car to a sudden dead stop. The small figure
partly uncrumpled, and a white, blinded little face lifted
toward me. It was Bob's youngster! What was she up
to, lying there on the ribbed concrete at this time of night?
And in heaven's name&mdash;why the dinner pail? I jumped
down to investigate.</p>

<p>"You're Susan Blake, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes"&mdash;with a whispered gasp&mdash;"your Royal Highness."</p>

<p>Susan says she doesn't know just why she addressed the
devil in that way, unless she was trying to flatter him
and so get round him.</p>

<p>"I'm not so awfully bad," she went on, "if you don't
count thinking things too much!"</p>

<p>The right cheek of her otherwise delicately modeled
child's face was a swollen lump of purple and green. I
dropped down on one knee beside her.</p>

<p>"Why, you poor little lady! You're hurt!"</p>

<p>Instantly she sprang to her feet, wild-eyed.</p>

<p>"No, no! It's not me&mdash;it's Pearl! Oh, quick&mdash;please!
He had a razor!"</p>

<p>"Razor? <i>Who</i> did?" I seized her hands. "I'm Mr.
Hunt, dear. Your father often works on my car. Tell
me what's wrong!"</p>

<p>She was still half dazed. "I&mdash;I can't see why I'm down
here&mdash;with papa's dinner pail. Pearl was upstairs, and
I tried to stop him from going." Then she began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
whimper like a whipped puppy. "It's all mixed. I'm
scared."</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;of course you are; but it's going to be all
right." I led her to the car and lifted her to the front
seat. "Hold on a minute, Susan. I'll be back with you
in less than no time!"</p>

<p>I sounded my horn impatiently. After an interval, a
slow-footed car washer inside the garage began trundling
the doors back to admit me. I ran to him.</p>

<p>No. Bob, he left at six, same as usual. He hadn't
been round since.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. His kid, eh? Mebbe the heat had
turned her queer. Nuff to addle most folks, the heat
was.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I saw that he knew nothing, and snapped him off with
a sharp request to crank the car for me. As he did so,
I jumped in beside Susan.</p>

<p>"Where do you live, Susan? Oh, yes, of course&mdash;Birch
Street. Bob told me that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Eh? You don't want to
go home?"</p>

<p>"Never, please. Never, never! I <i>won't!</i>" Proclaiming
this, she flung Bob's dinner pail from her and it
bounced and clattered down the asphalt. "It's too
late," she added, in a frightened whisper: "I know it is!"</p>

<p>Then she seized my arm&mdash;thereby almost wrecking us
against a fire hydrant&mdash;and clung to me, sobbing. I
was puzzled and&mdash;yes&mdash;alarmed. Bob was a bad customer.
The child's bruised face .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. something she had
said about a razor&mdash;&mdash;? And instantly I made up my
mind.</p>

<p>"I'll take you to my house, Susan. Mrs. Parrot"&mdash;Mrs.
Parrot was my housekeeper&mdash;"will fix you up for
to-night. Then I'll go round and see Bob; see what's
wrong." I felt her thin fingers dig into my arm convulsively.
"Yes," I reassured her, taking a corner perilously
at full speed, "that will be much better. You'll
like Mrs. Parrot."</p>

<p>Rather recklessly, I hoped this might prove to be true;
for Mrs. Parrot was a little difficult at times.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Maltby Phar who saw me coming up the steps
with a limp child in my arms, and who opened the screen
door for me. "Aha!" he exclaimed. "Done it this time,
eh! Always knew you would, sooner or later. You're
too damned absent-minded to drive a car. You&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" I struck in. "Tell Mrs. Parrot to ring up
Doctor Stevens. Then send her to me." And I continued
on upstairs with Susan.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Parrot came, Susan was lying with closed
eyes in the middle of a great white embroidered coverlet,
upon which her shoes had smeared greasy, permanent-looking
stains.</p>

<p>"Mercy," sighed Mrs. Parrot, "if you've killed the
poor creature, nobody's sorrier than I am! But why
couldn't you have laid her down on the floor? She
wouldn't have known."</p>

<p>In certain respects Mrs. Parrot was invaluable to me;
but then and there I suspected that Mrs. Parrot would,
in the not-too-distant future, have to go.</p>

<p>Within five minutes Doctor Stevens arrived, and, after
hurried explanations, Maltby and I left him in charge&mdash;and
then made twenty-five an hour to Birch Street.</p>

<p>However, Susan's intuitions had been correct. We
found Bob's four-room house quite easily. It was the
house with the crowd in front of it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We were an hour
too late.</p>

<p>"Cut her throat clean acrost; and his own after,"
shrilled Mrs. Perkins to us&mdash;Mrs. Perkins, who lived three
doors nearer the right end of Birch Street. "But it's only
what was to be looked for, and I guess it'll be a lesson
to some. You can't expect no better end than that,"
perorated Mrs. Perkins to us and her excited neighbors,
while her small gray-green eyes snapped with electric
malice, "you can't expect no better end than that to sech
<i>brazen</i> immorality!"</p>

<p>"My God," groaned Maltby, as we sped away, "How
they have enjoyed it all! Why, you almost ruined the
evening for them when you told them you'd found the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
child! They were hoping to discover her body in the
cellar or down the well. Ugh! What a world!</p>

<p>"By the way," he added, as we turned once more
into the dignified breadth of Hillhouse Avenue, "what'll
you do with the homely little brat? Put her in some kind
of awful institution?"</p>

<p>The bland tone of his assumption irritated me. I
ground on the brakes.</p>

<p>"Certainly not! I like her. If she returns the compliment,
and her relatives don't claim her, she'll stay on
here with me."</p>

<p>"Hum. Bravo.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. About two weeks," said Maltby
Phar.</p>

<h2>THE SECOND CHAPTER</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<div class='cap'>IT was not Susan who left me at the end of two weeks;
it was Mrs. Parrot. Maltby had departed within three
days, hastening perforce to editorial duties in New York.
He then edited, with much furtive groaning to sympathetic
friends, the <i>Garden Exquisite</i>, a monthly magazine
<i>de luxe</i>, devoted chiefly to advertising matter, and
to photographs taken&mdash;by request of far-seeing wives and
daughters&mdash;at the country clubs and on the country estates
of our minor millionaires. For a philosophical anarch,
rather a quaint occupation! Yet one must live.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Maltby, however, had threatened a return as soon as possible,
"to look over the piteous <i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i>." There was no
probability that Mrs. Parrot would ever return.</div>

<p>"You cannot expect me," maintained Mrs. Parrot, "to
wait on the child of a murdering suicide. Especially," she
added, "when he was nothing but a common sort of man
to begin with. I'm as sorry for that poor little creature
as anybody in New Haven; but there are places for such."</p>

<p>That was her ultimatum. My reply was two weeks'
notice, and a considerable monetary gift to soften the
blow.</p>

<p>Hillhouse Avenue, in general, so far as I could discover,
rather sympathized with Mrs. Parrot. She at once
obtained an excellent post, becoming housekeeper for the
Misses Carstairs, spinster sisters of incredible age, who
lived only two doors from me in a respectable mansion
whose portico resembled an Egyptian tomb. Wandering
freshmen from the Yale campus frequently mistook it for
the home office of one of the stealthier secret societies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>There, silently ensconced, Mrs. Parrot burned with a
hard, gemlike flame, and awaited my final downfall. So
did the Misses Carstairs, who, being cousins of my wife,
had remained firmly in opposition. And rumor had it
that other members of neighboring families were suffering
discomfort from the proximity of Susan. It was as if
a tiny, almost negligible speck of coal dust had blown
into the calm, watchful eye of the <i>genius loci</i>, and was
gradually inflaming it&mdash;with resultant nervous irritation
to all its members.</p>

<p>Susan was happily unconscious of these things. Her
gift of intuition had not yet projected itself into that
ethereal region which conserves the more tenuous tone and
the subtler distinction&mdash;denominate "society." For the
immediate moment she was bounded in a nutshell, yet
seemed to count herself a princess of infinite space&mdash;yes,
in spite of bad dreams. We&mdash;Doctor Stevens and I&mdash;had
put her to bed in the large, coolly distinguished corner
room formerly occupied by Gertrude. This room opened
directly into my own. Doctor Stevens counselled bed for
a few days, and Susan seemed well content to obey his
mandate. Meanwhile, I had requested Mrs. Parrot to buy
various necessities for her&mdash;toothbrushes, nightdresses, day
dresses, petticoats, and so on. Mrs. Parrot had supposed I
should want the toilet articles inexpensive, and the clothing
plain but good.</p>

<p>"Good, by all means, Mrs. Parrot," I had corrected,
"but not plain. As pretty and frilly as possible!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrot had been inclined to argue the matter.</p>

<p>"When that poor little creature goes from here," she
had maintained, "flimsy, fussy things will be of no service
to her. None. She'll need coarse, substantial articles
that will bear usage."</p>

<p>"Do you like to wear coarse, substantial articles, Mrs.
Parrot?" I had mildly asked. "So far as I am permitted
to observe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrot had resented the implication. "I hope in
my outer person, Mr. Hunt, that I show a decent respect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
for my employers, but I've never been one to pamper
myself on linjery, if I may use the word&mdash;not believing
it wholesome. Nor to discuss it with gentlemen. But
if I don't know what it's wisest and best to buy in this
case, who," she had demanded of heaven, "does?"</p>

<p>"Possibly," heaven not replying, had been my response,
"<i>I</i> do. At any rate, I can try."</p>

<p>It was fun trying. I ran down on the eight o'clock
to New York and strolled up and down Fifth Avenue,
shopping here and there as the fancy moved me. Shopping&mdash;with
a well-filled pocketbook&mdash;is not a difficult art.
Women exaggerate its difficulties for their own malign
purposes. In two hours of the most casual activity I had
bought a great number of delightful things&mdash;for my little
daughter, you know. Her age?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, well&mdash;I should
think about fourteen. Let's call it 'going on fourteen.'
Then it's sure to be all right.</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> all right&mdash;essentially. By which I mean that the
parties of the first and second parts&mdash;to wit, Susan and
I&mdash;were entirely and blissfully satisfied.</p>

<p>Susan liked particularly a lacy sort of nightgown all
knotted over with little pink ribbony rosebuds; there was
a coquettish boudoir cap to match it&mdash;suggestive somehow
of the caps village maidens used to wear in old-fashioned
comic operas; and a pink silk kimono embroidered
with white chrysanthemums, to top off the general effect.
Needless to say, Mrs. Parrot disapproved of the general
effect, deeming it, no doubt with some reason, a thought
flamboyant for Gertrude's coolly distinguished corner
room.</p>

<p>But Susan, propped straight up by now against pillows,
wantoned in this finery. She would stroke the pink silk
of the kimono with her thin, sensitive fingers, sigh deeply,
happily, then close her eyes.</p>

<p>There was nothing much wrong with her. The green-and-purple
bruise on her cheek&mdash;a somber note which
would not harmonize with the frivolity of the boudoir
cap&mdash;was no longer painful. But, as Doctor Stevens put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
it, "The little monkey's all in." She was tired, tired out
to the last tiny filament of her tiniest nerve.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>During those first days with me she asked no awkward
questions; and few of any kind. Indeed, she rarely spoke
at all, except with her always-speaking black eyes. For
the time being the restless-terrier-look had gone from
them; they were quiet and deep, and said "<i>Thank you</i>,"
to Doctor Stevens, to Mrs. Parrot, to me, with a hundred
modulating shades of expression. In spite of a clear-white,
finely drawn face, against which the purple bruise
stood out in shocking relief; in spite of entirely straight
but gossamery black hair; in spite of a rather short nose
and a rather wide mouth&mdash;there was a fascination about
the child which no one, not even the hostile Mrs. Parrot,
wholly escaped.</p>

<p>"That poor, peeny little creature," admitted Mrs. Parrot,
on the very morning she left me, "has a way of looking
at you&mdash;so you can't talk to her like you'd ought to.
It's somebody's duty to speak to her in a Christian spirit.
She never says her prayers. Nor mentions her father.
And don't seem to care what's happened to him, or why
she's here, or what's to come to her. And what is to
come to her," demanded Mrs. Parrot, "if she stays on in
this house, without a God-fearing woman, and one you
can't fool most days? Not that I could be persuaded,
having made other arrangements. And if I may say a
last word, the wild talk I've heard here isn't what I've
been used to. Nor to be approved of. No vulgarity.
None. I don't accuse. But free with matters better left
to the church; or in the dark&mdash;where they belong. All
I hold is, that some things are sacred, and some unmentionable;
and conversation should take cognizance of
such!"</p>

<p>I had never known her so moved or so eloquent. I
strove to reassure her.</p>

<p>"You are quite right, Mrs. Parrot. I apologize for any
painful moments my friends and I have given you. But
don't worry too much about Susan. So far as Susan's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
concerned, I promise to 'take cognizance' in every possible
direction."</p>

<p>It was clear to me that I should have to expend a good
deal of care upon engaging another housekeeper at once.
And, of course, a governess&mdash;for lessons and things. And
a maid? Yes; Susan would need a maid, if only to do her
mending. Obviously, neither the housekeeper, the governess,
nor I could be expected to take cognizance of that.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>But I anticipate. Two weeks before Mrs. Parrot's
peroration, on the very evening of the day Maltby Phar
had left me, Susan and I had had our first good talk together.
My memorable shopping tour had not yet come
off, and Susan, having pecked birdlike at a very light
supper, was resting&mdash;semi-recumbent&mdash;in bed, clothed in a
suit of canary-yellow pajamas, two sizes too big for her,
which I was rather shaken to discover belonged to Nora,
my quiet little Irish parlor maid. I had not supposed that
Nora indulged in night gear filched from musical comedy.
However, Nora had meant to be kind in a good cause;
though canary yellow is emphatically a color for the
flushed and buxom and should never be selected for peeny,
anemic little girls. It did make Susan look middling
ghastly, as if quarantined from all access to Hygeia, the
goddess! Perhaps that is why, when I perched beside
her on the edge of Gertrude's colonial four-poster, I felt
an unaccustomed prickling sensation back of my eyes.</p>

<p>"How goes it, canary bird?" I asked, taking the thin,
blue-threaded hand that lay nearest to me.</p>

<p>Susan's fingers at once curled trustfully to mine, and
there came something very like a momentary glimmer of
mischief into her dark eyes.</p>

<p>"If I was an honest-to-God canary, I could sing to
you," said Susan. "I'd like to do something for you,
Mr. Hunt. Something you'd like, I mean."</p>

<p>"Well, you can, dear. You can stop calling me 'Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Hunt'! My first name's pretty awkward, though. It's
Ambrose."</p>

<p>For an instant Susan considered my first name, critically,
then very slowly shook her head. "It's a nice name.
It's <i>too</i> nice, isn't it&mdash;for every day?"</p>

<p>I laughed. "But it's all I have, Susan. What shall
we do about it?"</p>

<p>Then Susan laughed, too; it was the first time I had
heard her laugh. "I guess your mother was feeling
kind of stuck up when she called you that!"</p>

<p>"Most mothers do feel kind of stuck up over their first
babies, Susan."</p>

<p>She considered this, and nodded assent, "But it's silly
of them, anyway," she announced. "There are so many
babies all the time, everywhere. There's nothing new
about babies, Ambo."</p>

<p>"Aha!" I exclaimed. "You knew from the first how
to chasten my stuck-up name, didn't you? 'Ambo' is a
delightful improvement."</p>

<p>"It's more like you," said Susan, tightening her fingers
briefly on mine.</p>

<p>And presently she closed her eyes. When, after a long
still interval, she opened them, they were cypress-shaded
pools.</p>

<p>"Tell me what happened, Ambo."</p>

<p>"He's dead, Susan. Pearl's dead, too."</p>

<p>She closed her eyes again, and two big tears slipped out
from between her lids, wetting her thick eyelashes and
staining her bruised and her pallid cheek.</p>

<p>"He couldn't help it. He was made like that, inside.
He was no damn good, Ambo. That's what he was always
saying to Pearl&mdash;'You're no damn good.' She wasn't,
either. And he wasn't, much. I guess it's better for him
and Pearl to <i>be</i> dead."</p>

<p>This&mdash;and the two big tears&mdash;was her good-by to Bob,
to Pearl, to the four-room house; her good-by to Birch
Street. It shocked me at the time. I released her hand
and stood up to light a cigarette&mdash;staring the while at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Susan. Where had she found her precocious brains?
And had she no heart? Had something of Bob's granitic
harshness entered into this uncanny, this unnatural child?
Should I live to regret my decision to care for her, to educate
her? When I died, would she say&mdash;to whom?&mdash;"I
guess it's better for him to <i>be</i> dead. Poor Ambo! He
was no damn good."</p>

<p>But even as I shuddered, I smiled. For, after all, she
was right; the child was right. She had merely uttered,
truthfully, thoughts which a more conventional mind,
more conventionally disciplined, would have known how to
conceal&mdash;yes, to conceal even from itself. Genius was
very like that.</p>

<p>"Susan!" I suddenly demanded. "Have you any relatives
who will try to claim you?"</p>

<p>"Claim me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Want to take care of you?"</p>

<p>"Mamma's sister-in-law lives in Hoboken," said Susan.
"But she's a widow; and she's got seven already."</p>

<p>"Would you like to stay here with me?"</p>

<p>For all answer she flopped sidelong down from the pillows
and hid her bruised face in the counterpane. Her
slight, canary-clad shoulders were shaken with stifled
weeping.</p>

<p>"That settles it!" I affirmed. "I'll see my lawyer in
the morning, and he'll get the court to appoint me your
guardian. Come now! If you cry about it, I'll think you
don't want me for guardian. Do you?"</p>

<p>She turned a blubbered, wistful face toward me from
the counterpane. Her eyes answered me. I leaned over,
smoothed a pillow and slipped it beneath her tired head,
then kissed her unbruised cheek and walked quietly back
into my own room&mdash;where I rang for Mrs. Parrot.</p>

<p>When she arrived, "Mrs. Parrot," I suggested, "please
make Susan comfortable for the night, will you? And I'll
appreciate it if you treat her exactly as you would my own
child."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>It took Mrs. Parrot at least a minute to hit upon something
she quite dared to leave with me.</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Hunt. Not having an own child, and
not knowing&mdash;you can say that. Not that it's the same
thing, though you <i>do</i> say it! But I'll make her comfortable&mdash;and
time tells. In darker days, I hope you'll be
able to say that poor, peeny little creature has done the
same by you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. Parrot. Good-night."</p>

<p>"A good night to you, Mr. Hunt," elaborated Mrs. Parrot,
not without malice; "many of them, Mr. Hunt; many
of them, I'm sure."</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>By the time Mrs. Parrot left us, housekeeper, governess,
and maid had been obtained in New York through agencies
of the highest respectability.</p>

<p>Miss Goucher, the housekeeper, proved to be a tall,
big-framed spinster, rising fifty; a capable, taciturn
woman with a positive talent for minding her own affairs.
She had bleak, light-gray eyes, a rudderlike nose, and a
harsh, positive way of speech that was less disagreeable
than it might have been, because she so seldom spoke at
all. Having hoped for a more amiable presence, I was
of two minds over keeping her; but she took charge of my
house so promptly and efficiently, and effaced herself so
thoroughly&mdash;a difficult feat for so definite a figure&mdash;that
in the end there was nothing I could complain of; and so
she stayed.</p>

<p>Miss Disbrow on the other hand, who came as governess,
was all that I had dared to wish for; a graceful,
light-footed, soft-voiced girl&mdash;she was not yet thirty&mdash;with
charming manners, a fluent command of the purest
convent-taught French, a nice touch on the piano, and apparently
some slight acquaintance with the solider
branches. Merely to associate with Miss Disbrow would,
I felt, do much for Susan.</p>

<p>I was less certain about Sonia, the maid. I had asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
for a middle-aged English maid. Sonia was Russian, and
she was only twenty-three. But she was sent directly to
me from service with Countess Dimbrovitski&mdash;formerly, as
you know, Maud Hochstetter, of Omaha&mdash;and brought
with her a most glowing reference for skill, honesty, and
unfailing tact. Countess Dimbrovitski did not explain in
the reference, dated from Newport, why she had permitted
this paragon to slip from her; nor did it occur to me to
investigate the point. But Sonia later explained it all, in
intimate detail, to Susan&mdash;as we shall see.</p>

<p>I had feared that Susan might be at first a little bewildered
by the attentions of Sonia and of Miss Disbrow;
so I explained the unusual situation to Miss Goucher and
Miss Disbrow&mdash;with certain reservations&mdash;and asked them
to make it clear to Sonia. Miss Goucher merely nodded,
curtly enough, and said she understood. Miss Disbrow
proved more curious and more voluble.</p>

<p>"How wonderful of you, Mr. Hunt!" she exclaimed.
"To take in a poor little waif and do all this for her!
Personally, I count it a privilege to be allowed some share
in so generous an action. Oh, but I do&mdash;I do. One likes
to feel, even when forced to work for one's living, that
one has some little opportunity to do good in the world.
Life isn't," asked Miss Disbrow, "all money-grubbing and
selfishness, is it?" And as I found no ready answer, she
concluded: "But I need hardly ask that of you!"</p>

<p>For the fleetingest second I found myself wondering
whether Miss Disbrow, deep down in her hidden heart,
might not be a minx. Yet her glance, the happiest mixture
of frankness, timidity, and respectful admiration, disarmed
me. I dismissed the unworthy suspicion as absurd.</p>

<p>I was a little troubled, though, when Susan that same
evening after dinner came to me in the library and seated
herself on a low stool facing my easy-chair.</p>

<p>"Ambo," she said, "I've been blind as blind,
haven't I?"</p>

<p>"Have you?" I responded. "For a blind girl, it's wonderful
how you find your way about!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I'm not joking&mdash;and that's just it," said Susan.</p>

<p>"What's wrong, dear?" I asked. "I see something is."</p>

<p>"Yes. I am. The wrongest possible. I've just dumped
myself on you, and stayed here; and&mdash;and I've no damn
business here at all!"</p>

<p>"I thought we were going to forget the damns and
hells, Susan?"</p>

<p>"We are," said Susan, coloring sharply and looking
as if she wanted to cry. "But when you've heard them,
and worse, every minute all your life&mdash;it's pretty hard to
forget. You must scold me more!" Then with a swift
movement she leaned forward and laid her cheek on my
knee. "You're too good to me, Ambo. I oughtn't to be
here&mdash;wearing wonderful dresses, having a maid to do my
hair and&mdash;and polish me and button me and mend me.
I wasn't meant to have an easy time; I wasn't born for
it. First thing you know, Ambo, I'll get to thinking I was&mdash;and
be mean to you somehow!"</p>

<p>"I'll risk that, Susan."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I oughtn't to let you. I could learn to be
somebody's maid like Sonia; and if I study hard&mdash;and I'm
going to!&mdash;some day I could be a governess like Miss Disbrow;
only really know things, not just pretend. Or when
I'm old enough, a housekeeper like Miss Goucher! That's
what you should make me do&mdash;work for you! I can clean
things better than Nora now; I never skip underneaths.
Truly, Ambo, it's all wrong, my having people work for
me&mdash;at your expense. I know it is! Miss Disbrow made
it all clear as clear, right away."</p>

<p>"What! Has Miss Disbrow been stuffing this nonsense
into your head!" I was furious.</p>

<p>"Oh, not in words!" cried Susan. "She talks just the
other way. She keeps telling me how fortunate I am to
have a guardian like you, and how I must be so careful
never to annoy you or make you regret what you've done
for me. Then she sighs and says life is very hard and
unjust to many girls born with more advantages. Of
course she means herself, Ambo. You see, she hates having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to work at all. She's much nicer to look at and talk to,
but she reminds me of Pearl. She's no damn&mdash;she's no
good, Ambo dear. She's hard where she ought to be soft,
and soft where she ought to be hard. She tries to get
round people, so she can coax things out of them. But
she'll never get round Miss Goucher, Ambo&mdash;or me."
And Susan hesitated, lifting her head from my knee and
looking up at me doubtfully, only to add, "I&mdash;I'm not so
sure about <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"Indeed. You think, possibly, Miss Disbrow might get
round me, eh?"</p>

<p>"Well, she might&mdash;if I wasn't here," said Susan. "She
might marry you."</p>

<p>My explosion of laughter&mdash;I am ordinarily a quiet person&mdash;startled
Susan. "Have I said something awful
again?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Dreadful!" I sputtered, wiping my eyes. "Why, you
little goose! Don't you see how I need you? To plumb
the depths for me&mdash;to protect me? I thought I was your
guardian, Susan; but that's just my mannish complacency.
I'm not your guardian at all, dear. You're mine."</p>

<p>But I saw at once that my mirth had confused her, had
hurt her feelings.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I reached out for her hands and
drew her upon my knees.</p>

<p>"Susan," I said, "Miss Disbrow couldn't marry me
even if she got round me, and wanted to. You see, I have
a wife already."</p>

<p>Susan stared at me with wide, frightened eyes. "You
have, Ambo? Where is she?"</p>

<p>"She left me two years ago."</p>

<p>"Left you?" It was evident that she did not understand.
"Oh&mdash;what will she say when she comes home and
finds <i>me</i> here? She won't like it; she won't like me!"
wailed Susan. "I know she won't."</p>

<p>"Hush, dear. She's not coming home again. She made
up her mind that she couldn't live with me any more."</p>

<p>"What's her name?"</p>

<p>"Gertrude."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why couldn't she live with you, Ambo?"</p>

<p>"She said I was cruel to her."</p>

<p>"<i>Weren't</i> you good to her, Ambo? Why? Didn't you
like her?"</p>

<p>The rapid questions were so unexpected, so searching,
that I gasped. And my first impulse was to lie to Susan,
to put her off with a few conventional phrases&mdash;phrases
that would lead the child to suppose me a wronged, lonely,
broken-hearted man. This would win me a sympathy I
had not quite realized that I craved. But Susan's eyes
were merciless, and I couldn't manage it. Instead, I surprised
myself by blurting out: "That's about it, Susan.
I didn't like her&mdash;enough. We couldn't hit it off, somehow.
I'm afraid I wasn't very kind."</p>

<p>Instantly Susan's thin arms went about my neck, and
her cheek was pressed tight to mine.</p>

<p>"Poor Ambo!" she whispered. "I'm so sorry you
weren't kind. It must <i>hurt</i> you so." Then she jumped
from my knees.</p>

<p>"Ambo!" she demanded. "Is my room&mdash;<i>her</i> room?
Is it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. It isn't hers any more. She's never
coming back, I tell you. She put me out of her life once
for all; and God knows I've put her out of mine!"</p>

<p>"If you can't let me have another room, Ambo&mdash;I'll
have to go."</p>

<p>"Why? Hang it all, Susan, don't be silly! Don't make
difficulties where none exist! What an odd, overstrained
child you are!" I was a little annoyed.</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Susan gravely, "I see now why Gertrude
left you. But she must be awfully stupid not to
know it's only your outside that's made like that!"</p>

<p>Next morning, without a permissive word from me,
Susan had Miss Goucher move all her things to a small
bedroom at the back of the house, overlooking the garden.
This silent flitting irritated me not a little, and that afternoon
I had a frank little talk with Miss Disbrow&mdash;franker,
perhaps, than I had intended. Miss Disbrow at once gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
me notice, and left for New York within two hours, letting
it be known that she expected her trunks to be sent
after her.</p>

<p>"Gutter-snipes are not my specialty," was her parting
word.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>There proved to be little difficulty in getting myself
appointed Susan's guardian. No one else wanted the
child.</p>

<p>I promised the court to do my best for her; to treat
her, in fact, as I would my own flesh and blood. It might
well be, I said, that before long I should legally adopt
her. In any event, if this for some unforeseen reason
proved inadvisable, I assured the court that Susan's future
would be provided for. The court benignly replied
that, as it stood, I was acting very handsomely in the
matter; very handsomely; no doubt about it. But there
was a dim glimmer behind the juridic spectacles that
seemed to imply: "Handsomely, my dear sir, but whether
wisely or no is another question, which, as the official
champion of widows and orphans, I am not called upon
to decide."</p>

<p>It was with a new sense of responsibility that I opened
an account in Susan's name with a local savings bank, and
a week later added a short but efficient codicil to my will.</p>

<p>In the meantime&mdash;but with alert suspicions&mdash;I interviewed
several highly recommended applicants for Miss
Disbrow's deserted post; only to find them wanting.
Poor things! Combined, they could hardly have met all
the requirements, &aelig;sthetic and intellectual, which I had
now set my heart upon finding in one lone governess for
Susan! It would have needed, by this, a subtly modernized
Hypatia to fulfill my ideal.</p>

<p>I might, of course, have waited for October to send
Susan to a select private school in the vicinage, patronized
by the little daughters of our more cautious families.
It was, by neighborly consent, an excellent school, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
carefully sterilized cultures&mdash;physical, moral, mental, and
social&mdash;were painlessly injected into the blue blood
streams of our very nicest young girls. I say that I might
have done so, but this is a euphemism. On the one hand,
I shrank from exposing Susan to possible snubs; on the
other, a little bird whispered that Miss Garnett, principal
of the school, would not care to expose her carefully sterilized
cultures to an alien contagion. Bearers of contagion&mdash;whether
physical, moral, mental, or social&mdash;were
not sympathetic to Miss Garnett's <i>client&egrave;le</i>. In Mrs. Parrot's
iron phrase, there are places for such.</p>

<p>Public schools, to wit! But in those long-past days&mdash;before
Susan taught me that there are just two kinds of
persons, big and little; those you can do nothing for, because
they can do nothing for themselves, and those you
can do nothing for, because they can do everything for
themselves&mdash;in those days, I admit that I had my own
finicky fears. Public schools were all very well for the
children of men who could afford nothing better. They
had, for example, given Bob Blake's daughter a pretty
fair preliminary training; but they would never do for
Ambrose Hunt's ward. <i>Noblesse</i>&mdash;or, at any rate, <i>largesse</i>&mdash;<i>oblige</i>.</p>

<p>Yet here was a quandary: Public schools, in my estimation,
being too vulgar for Susan; and Susan, in the estimation
of Hillhouse Avenue, being too vulgar for private
ones; yea, and though I still took cognizance, no subtly
modernized Hypatia coming to me highly recommended
for a job&mdash;how in the name of useless prosperity was I to
get poor little Susan properly educated at all!</p>

<p>It was Susan who solved this difficulty for me, as she
was destined to solve most of my future difficulties, and
all of her own.</p>

<p>She soon turned the public world about her into an
extra-select, super-private school. She impressed all who
came into contact with her, and made of them her devoted&mdash;if
often unconscious&mdash;instructors. And she began
by impressing Miss Goucher and Nora and Sonia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and Philip Farmer, assistant professor of philosophy in
Yale University; and Maltby Phar, anarchist editor of
<i>The Garden Exquisite;</i> and&mdash;first and chiefly&mdash;me.</p>

<p>The case of Phil Farmer was typical. Phil and I had
been classmates in the dark backward and abysm, and we
were still, in a manner of speaking, friends. I mean that,
though we had few tastes in common, we kept on liking
each other a good deal. Phil was a gentle-hearted, stiff-headed
sort of man, with a conscience&mdash;formed for him
and handed on by a long line of Unitarian ministers&mdash;a
conscience which drove him to incredible labor at altitudes
few of us attain, and where even Phil, it seemed to
me, found breathing difficult. Not having been thrown
with much feminine society on his chosen heights, he had
remained a bachelor. The Metaphysical Mountains are
said to be infested with women, but they cluster, I am
told, below the snow line. Phil did not even meet them
by climbing through them; he always ballooned straight
up for the Unmelting; and when he occasionally dropped
down, his psychic chill seldom wore entirely off before
he was ready to ascend again. This protected him; for
he was a tall, dark-haired fellow whose features had the
clear-cut gravity of an Indian chieftain; his rare, friendly
smile was a delight. So he would hardly otherwise have
escaped.</p>

<p>Perhaps once a week it was his habit to drop in after
dinner and share with me three or four pipes' worth of
desultory conversation. We seldom talked shop; since
mine did not interest him, nor his me. Mostly we just
ambled aimlessly round the outskirts of some chance
neutral topic&mdash;who would win the big game, for example.
It amused neither of us, but it rested us both.</p>

<p>One night, perhaps a month after Susan had come to
me, I returned late from a hot day's trip to New York&mdash;one
more unsuccessful quest after Hypatia Rediviva&mdash;and
found Phil and Susan sitting together on the screened
terrace at the back of my house, overlooking the garden.
It was not my custom to spend the muggy midsummer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
months in town, but this year I had been unwilling to
leave until I could capture and carry off Hypatia Rediviva
with me. Moreover, I did not know where to go. The cottage
at Watch Hill belonged to Gertrude, and was in consequence
no longer used by either of us. As a grass
widower I had, in summer, just travelled about. Now,
with a ward of fourteen to care for, just travelling about
no longer seemed the easiest solution; yet I hated camps
and summer hotels. I should have to rent a place somewhere,
that was certain; but where? With the world to
choose from, a choice proved difficult. I was marking
time.</p>

<p>My stuffy fruitless trip had decided me to mark time
no longer. Hypatia or no Hypatia, Susan must be taken
to the hills or the sea. It was this thought that simmered
in my brain as I strolled out to the garden terrace and
overheard Susan say to Phil: "But I think it's <i>much</i>
easier to believe in the devil than it is in God! Don't
you? The devil isn't all-wise, all-good, all-everything!
He's a lot more like <i>us</i>."</p>

<p>I stopped short and shamelessly listened.</p>

<p>"That's an interesting concept," responded Phil, with
his slow, friendly gravity. "You mean, I suppose, that
if we must be anthropomorphic, we ought at least to be
consistent."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be funny," said Susan, "if I did mean
that without knowing it?" There was no flippancy, no
irony in her tone. "'<i>An-thro-po-mor-phic</i> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. '" she
added, savoring its long-drawn-outness. Susan never
missed a strange word; she always pounced on it at once,
unerringly, and made it hers.</p>

<p>"That's a Greek word," explained Phil.</p>

<p>"It's a good word," said Susan, "if it has a tremendous
lot packed up in it. If it hasn't, it's much too long."</p>

<p>"I agree with you," said Phil; "but it has."</p>

<p>"What?" asked Susan.</p>

<p>"It would take me an hour to tell you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I'm glad!" cried Susan. "It must be a wonderful
word! Please go on till Ambo comes!"</p>

<p>I decided to take a bath, and tiptoed softly and undetected
away.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>After that evening Phil began to drop in every two
or three nights, and he did not hesitate to tell me that
the increasing frequency of his visits was due to his progressive
interest in Susan.</p>

<p>"She's a curious child," he explained; which was true
in any sense you chose to take it, and all the way back
to the Latin <i>curiosus</i>, "careful, diligent, thoughtful; from
<i>cura</i>, care," and so on.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"I've never seen much of children," Phil continued;
"never had many chances, as it happens. My sister has
three boys, but she's married to a narrow-gauge missionary,
and lives&mdash;to call it that&mdash;in Ping Lung, or some such
place. I've the right address somewhere, I think&mdash;in a
notebook. Bertha sends me snapshots of the boys from
time to time, but I can't say I've ever felt lonely because
of their exile. Funny. Perhaps it's because I never
liked Bertha much. Bertha has a sloppy mind&mdash;you know,
with chance scraps of things floating round in it. Nothing
coheres. But you take this youngster of yours, now&mdash;I
call her yours&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do!" I interjected.</p>

<p>"Well, there's the opposite extreme! Susan links everything
up, everything she gets hold of&mdash;facts, fancies, guesses,
feelings; the whole psychic menagerie. Chains them all together
somehow, and seems to think they'll get on comfortably
in the same tent. Of course they won't&mdash;can't&mdash;and
that's the danger for her! But she's stimulating,
Hunt"&mdash;Phil always called me Hunt, as if just failing
whole-heartedly to accept me&mdash;"she's positively stimulating!
A mind like that must be trained; thoroughly, I
mean. We must do our best for her."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>The "we" amused me and&mdash;yes, I confess it&mdash;nettled
me a little.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that," I said, and more dryly than
I had meant to; "I'm combing the country now for a
suitable governess."</p>

<p>"Governess!" Phil snorted. "You don't want a governess
for Susan. You want, for this job," he insisted, "a
male intellect&mdash;a vigorous, disciplined male intellect.
Music, dancing, water colors&mdash;pshaw! Deportment&mdash;how
to enter a drawing-room! Fiddle-faddle! How to enter
the Kingdom of God! That's more Susan's style," cried
Phil, with a most unaccustomed heat.</p>

<p>I laughed at him.</p>

<p>"Are you willing to take her on, Phil?" I asked. "I
believe it's been done; Epicurus had a female pupil or
two."</p>

<p>"I have taken her on," Phil replied, quite without resentment.
"Hadn't you noticed it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said; "only, it's the other way round."</p>

<p>"I've been appropriated, is that it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; by Susan. We all have, Phil. That vampire
child is simply draining us, my dear fellow."</p>

<p>"All right," said Phil, after a second's pause, "if she's
a <i>spiritual</i> vampire, so much the better. Only, she'll need
a firm hand. We must give her suck at regular hours;
draw up a plan. You can tackle the languages, if you
like&mdash;&aelig;sthetics, and all that. I'll pin her down to math
and logic&mdash;teach her to <i>think</i> straight. We can safely
leave her to pick up history and sociology and such things
for herself. You've a middling good library, and she'll
browse."</p>

<p>"Oh, she'll browse! She's browsing now."</p>

<p>"Poetry?" demanded Phil, suspicion in his tone,
anxiety in his eyes. "If she runs amuck with poetry
too soon, there's no hope for her. She'll get to taking
sensations for ideas, and that's fatal. A mind like
Susan's&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>What further he said I missed; a distant tinkle from
the front-door bell had distracted me.</p>

<p>It was Maltby Phar. He came out to us on the garden
terrace, unexpected and unannounced.</p>

<p>"Whether you like it or not," he sighed luxuriously,
"I'm here for a week. How's the great experiment&mdash;eh?
Am I too late for the bust-up?" Then he nodded to Phil.
"How are you, Mr. Farmer? Delighted to meet an old
adversary! Shall it be swords or pistols this time? Or
clubs? But I warn you, I'm no fit foe; I'm soft. Making
up our mammoth Christmas Number in July always
unnerves me. By the time I had looked over a dozen designs
for our cover this morning and found Gaspar, Melchior,
and Balthazar in every one of them, mounted on
fancy camels, and heading for an exaggerated star in the
right upper dark-blue corner, I succumbed to heat and
profanity, turned 'em all face downward, shuffled 'em,
grabbed one at random, and then fled for solace! Solace,"
he added, dropping into a wicker armchair, "can begin,
if you like, by taking a cool, mellow, liquid form."</p>

<p>I rang.</p>

<p>Phil, I saw, was looking annoyed. He disliked Maltby
Phar, openly disliked him; so I felt certain&mdash;I was perhaps
rather hoping&mdash;that he would take this opportunity
to escape. With Phil I was never then entirely at ease;
but in those days I was wholly so with Maltby. Miss
Goucher answered my summons in person, and I suggested
a sauterne cup for my friends. Phil frowned on
the suggestion, but Maltby beamed. The ayes had it,
and Miss Goucher, who had remained neutral, withdrew.
It was Phil's chance; yet he surprised me by settling back
and refilling his pipe.</p>

<p>"When you came, Mr. Phar," he said, his tone withdrawing
toward formality, "we were discussing the education
of Susan."</p>

<p>"Then I came just in time!" cried Maltby.</p>

<p>"For what?" I queried.</p>

<p>"I may prevent a catastrophe. If you're really going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to see this thing through, Boz"&mdash;his name for me&mdash;"for
God's sake do a little clear thinking first! Don't drift.
Don't flounder. Don't wallow. Scrap all your musty, inbred
prejudices once for all, and see that at least one kid on
this filthy old planet gets a plain, honest, unsentimentalized
account of what she is and what the world is. If you
can bring yourself to do that, Susan will be unique. She
will be the first educated woman in America."</p>

<p>"'What she is and what the world is,'" repeated Phil,
slowly. "What is the world, may I ask? And what is
Susan?"</p>

<p>There was a felt tenseness in the moment; the hush before
battle. We leaned forward a little from our easy-chairs,
and no one of us noticed that Susan had slipped
noiselessly to the window seat by the opened library window
which gave upon the terrace. But there, as we later
discovered, she was; and there, for the present silently, she
remained.</p>

<p>"The world," began Maltby Phar sententiously, "is a
pigsty."</p>

<p>"Very well," interrupted Phil; "I'll grant you that to
start with. What follows?"</p>

<p>"What we see about us," said Maltby.</p>

<p>"And what do we see?" asked Phil.</p>

<p>At this inopportune moment Miss Goucher reappeared,
bearing a Sheffield tray, on which stood three antique
Venetian goblets, and a tall pitcher of rare Bohemian
glass, filled to the brim with an iced sauterne cup garnished
with fresh strawberries and thin disks of pineapple.
Nothing less suggestive of the conventional back-lot piggery
could have been imagined. By the time a table had
been placed, our goblets filled, and Miss Goucher had retired,
Maltby had decided to try for a new opening.</p>

<p>"Excellent!" he resumed, having drained and refilled
his goblet. "Now, Mr. Farmer, if you really wish to know
what the world is, and what Susan is, I am ready. Have
with you! And by the way, Boz," he interjected, sipping
his wine, "your new housekeeper is one in a thousand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Mrs. Parrot was admirable; I've been absurdly regretting
her loss. But Mrs. Parrot never quite rose to <i>this!</i>"</p>

<p>Phil's tongue clicked an impatient protest against the
roof of his mouth. "I am still unenlightened, Mr. Phar."</p>

<p>"True," said Maltby. "That's the worst of you romantic
idealists. It's your permanent condition." He
settled back in his chair, and fell to his old trick of slowly
caressing the back of his left hand with the palm of his
right. "The world, my dear Mr. Farmer," he continued,
"the universe, indeed, as we have come gradually to
know it, is an infinity of blindly clashing forces. They
have always existed, they will always exist; they have always
been blind, and they always will be. Anything may
happen in such an infinity, and we&mdash;this world of men
and microbes&mdash;are one of the things which has temporarily
happened. It's regrettable, but it is so. And though
there is nothing final we can do about it, and very little
in any sense, still&mdash;this curious accident of the human intellect
enables us to do something. We can at least admit
the plain facts of our horrible case. Here, a self-realizing
accident, we briefly are. Death will dissipate us
one by one, and the world in due time. That much we
know. But while we last, why must we add imaginary
evils to our real ones, and torment ourselves with false
hopes and ridiculous fears?</p>

<p>"Why can't each one of us learn to say: 'I am an accident
of no consequence in a world that means nothing.
I might be a stone, but I happen to be a man. Hence,
certain things give me pleasure, others pain. And, obviously,
in an accidental, meaningless world I can owe no
duty to anyone but myself. I owe it to myself to get as
much pleasure and to avoid as much pain as possible. Unswerving
egotism should be my law.'" He paused to sip
again, with a side glance toward Phil.</p>

<p>"Elementary, all this, I admit. I apologize for restating
it to a scholar. But such are the facts as science
reveals them&mdash;are they not? You have to try somehow to
go beyond science to get round them. And where do you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
go&mdash;you romantic idealists? Where <i>can</i> you go? Nowhere
outside of yourselves, I take it. So you plunge,
perforce, down below the threshold of reason into a mad
chaos of instinct and desire and dream. And what <i>there</i>
do you find? Bugaboos, my dear sir, simply bugaboos:
divine orders, hells, heavens, purgatories, moral sanctions&mdash;all
the wild insanity, in two words, that had made our
wretched lives even less worth living than they could and
should be!"</p>

<p>"<i>Should?</i> Why <i>should?</i>" asked Phil. "Granting your
universe, who gives a negligible damn for a little discomfort
more or less?"</p>

<p>"I do!" Maltby asserted. "I want all the comfort I
can get; and I could get far more in a world of clear-seeing,
secular egotists than I can in this mixed mess of superstitious,
sentimental idealists which we choose to call
civilized society! Take just one minor practical illustration:
Say that some virgin has wakened my desire, and
I hers. In a reasonable society we could give each other
a certain amount of passing satisfaction. But do we do
it? No. The virgin has been taught to believe in a mystical,
mischievous something, called Purity! To follow
her natural instinct would be a sin. If you sin and get
caught on earth, society will punish you; and if you don't
get caught here, you'll infallibly get caught hereafter&mdash;and
then God will punish you. So the virgin tortures herself
and tortures me&mdash;unless I'm willing to marry her,
which would be certain to prove the worst of tortures for
us both. And there you are."</p>

<p>It was at this point that Susan spoke from her window.</p>

<p>"Pearl and papa weren't married, Mr. Phar; but they
didn't get much fun out of not being."</p>

<p>I confess that I felt a nervous chill start at the base of
my spine and shiver up toward my scalp. Even Phil,
the man of Indian gravity, looked for an instant perturbed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Susan!" I demanded sharply. "Have you been listening?"</p>

<p>"Mustn't I listen?" asked Susan. "Why not? Are
you cross, Ambo?"</p>

<p>"The mischief's done," said Phil to me quietly; "better
not make a point of it."</p>

<p>"Please don't be cross, Ambo," Susan pleaded, slipping
through the window to the terrace and coming
straight over to me. "Mr. Phar feels just the way papa
did about things; only papa couldn't talk so splendidly.
He had a very poor vocabulary"&mdash;"Vocabulary!" I
gasped&mdash;"except nasty words and swearing. But he
meant just what Mr. Phar means, <i>inside</i>."</p>

<p>Phil, as she ended, began to make strange choking
noises and retired suddenly into his handkerchief. Maltby
put down his glass and stared at Susan.</p>

<p>"Young person," he finally said, "you ought to be
spanked! Don't you know it's an unforgivable sin to spy
on your elders!"</p>

<p>"But you don't believe in sin," responded Susan
calmly, without the tiniest suspicion of pertness in her tone
or bearing. "You believe in doing what you want to.
<i>I</i> wanted to hear what you were saying, Mr. Phar."</p>

<p>"Of course you did!" Phil struck in. "But next time,
Susan, as a concession to good manners, you might let us
know you're in the neighborhood&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Susan bit her lower lip very hard before she managed
to reply.</p>

<p>"Yes. I will next time. I'm sorry, Phil." (<i>Phil!</i>)
Then she turned to Maltby. "But I wasn't spying! I
just didn't know you would any of you mind."</p>

<p>"We don't, really," I said. "Sit down, dear. You're
always welcome." I had been doing some stiff, concentrated
thinking in the last three minutes, and now I had
taken the plunge. "The truth is, Susan," I went on,
"that most children who live in good homes, who are what
is called 'well brought up,' are carefully sheltered from
any facts or words or thoughts which their parents do not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
consider wholesome or pleasant. Parents try to give their
children only what they have found to be best in life;
they try to keep them in ignorance of everything else."</p>

<p>"But they can't," said Susan. "At least, they
couldn't in Birch Street."</p>

<p>"No. Nor elsewhere. But they try. And they always
make believe to themselves that they have succeeded. So
it's supposed to be very shocking and dangerous for a girl
of your age to listen to the free conversation of men of
our age. That's the reason we all felt a little guilty, at
first, when we found you'd been overhearing us."</p>

<p>"How funny," said Susan. "Papa never cared."</p>

<p>"Good for him!" exclaimed Maltby. "I didn't feel
guilty, for one! I refuse to be convicted of so hypocritically
squeamish a reaction!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" Susan sighed, almost with rapture. "You
know such a lot of words, Mr. Phar! You can say anything."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Maltby; "I rather flatter myself that
I can."</p>

<p>"And you <i>do!</i>" grunted Phil. "But words," he took
up the dropped threads rather awkwardly, "are nothing in
themselves, Susan. You are too fond of mere words. It
isn't words that matter; it's ideas."</p>

<p>"Yes, Phil," said Susan meekly, "but I love words&mdash;best
of all when they're pictures."</p>

<p>Phil frowned, without visible effect upon Susan. I saw
that her mind had gone elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Ambo?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear?"</p>

<p>"You mustn't ever worry about me, Ambo. My hearing
or knowing things&mdash;or saying them. I&mdash;I guess I'm
different."</p>

<p>Maltby's face was a study in suppressed amazement;
Phil was still frowning. It was all too much for me, and
I laughed&mdash;laughed from the lower ribs!</p>

<p>Susan laughed with me, springing from her chair to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
throw her arms tightly round my neck in one big joyous
suffocating hug!</p>

<p>"Oh, Ambo!" she cried, breathless. "Isn't it going to
be fun&mdash;all of us&mdash;together&mdash;now we can <i>talk!</i>"</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The following evening, after dinner, Maltby Phar,
still a little ruffled by Susan's unexpected vivacities of
the night before, retired to the library with pipe and
book, and Susan and I sat alone together on the garden
terrace. It was dusk. The heavy air of the past week
had been quickened and purified by an afternoon thunderstorm.
Little cool puffs came to us across a bed of glimmering
white phlox, bearing with them its peculiar, loamy
fragrance. Smoke from my excellent cigarette eddied
now and then toward Susan.</p>

<p>Silence had stolen upon her as the afterglow faded, revealing
the first patient stars. Already I had learned to
respect Susan's silences. She was not, in the usual sense
of uncertain temper, of nervous irritability, a moody
child; yet she had her moods&mdash;moods, if I may put it so,
of extraordinary definition. There were hours, not too
frequent to be disturbing, when she <i>withdrew;</i> there is
no better word for it. At such times her thin, alert little
frame was motionless; she would sit as if holding a pose
for a portrait, her chin a trifle lifted, her eyes focusing on
no visible object, her hands lying&mdash;always with the palms
upward&mdash;in her lap. I supposed that now, with the
veiled yet sharply scented dusk, such a mood had crept
upon her. But for once I was mistaken. Susan, this
time, had not withdrawn; she was intensely aware.</p>

<p>"Ambo"&mdash;the suddenness with which she spoke startled
me&mdash;"you ought to have lots of children. You ought to
have a boy, anyway; not just a girl."</p>

<p>"A boy? Why, dear? Are you lonely?"</p>

<p>"Of course not; with you&mdash;and Phil!"</p>

<p>"Then whatever in the world put such a crazy&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Susan interrupted; a bad habit of hers, never subsequently
broken, and due, doubtless, to an instinctive impatience
of foreseeable remarks.</p>

<p>"You're so awfully rich, Ambo. You could have dozens
and not feel it&mdash;except that they'd get in your way sometimes
and make your outside cross. But two wouldn't be
much more trouble than one. It might seem a little crowded&mdash;at
first; but after while, Ambo, you'd hardly notice it."</p>

<p>"Possibly. Still&mdash;nice boys don't grow on bushes,
Susan. Not the kind of brothers I should have to insist
upon for you!"</p>

<p>"I'm not so fussy as all that," said Susan. "And it
isn't fair that I should have everything. Besides, Ambo,
boys are much nicer than girls. Honestly they are."</p>

<p>"Oh, are they! I'm afraid you haven't had much experience
with boys! Most of them are disgusting young
savages. Really, Susan! Their hands and feet are too
big for them, and their voices don't fit. They're always
breaking things&mdash;irreplaceable things for choice, and raising
the devil of a row. Take my word for it, dear, please.
I'm an ex-boy myself; I know all about 'em! They were
never created for civilized human companionship. Why,
I'd rather give you a young grizzly bear and be done with
it, than present you with the common-or-garden brother!
But if you'd like a nice quiet little sister some day, maybe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't," said Susan.</p>

<p>She was silent again for several moments, pondering. I
observed her furtively. Nothing was more distant from
my desire than any addition, of any age, male or female,
to my present family. Heaven, in its great and unwonted
kindness, had sent me Susan; she was&mdash;to my thinking&mdash;perfect;
and she was enough. Whether in art or in life I
am no lover of an avoidable anticlimax. But Susan's
secret purposes were not mine.</p>

<p>"Ambo," she resumed, "I guess if you'd ever lived in
Birch Street you'd feel differently about boys."</p>

<p>"I doubt it, Susan."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sure you'd feel differently about Jimmy."</p>

<p>"Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"Jimmy Kane, Ambo&mdash;<i>my</i> Jimmy. Haven't I ever
told you about him?"</p>

<p>Guilefully, persuasively, she edged her chair nearer to
mine.</p>

<p>It was then that I first learned of Jimmy's battle for
Susan, of the bloody but righteous downfall of Giuseppe
Gonfarone, and of many another incident long treasured
in the junior annals of Birch Street. Thus, little by little,
though the night deepened about us, my eyes were unsealed.
What a small world I had always lived in! For
how long had it seemed to me that romance was&mdash;approximately&mdash;dead!
My fingers tightened on Susan's, while the
much-interrogated stars hung above us in their mysterious
orbits and&mdash;&mdash; But no, that is the pathetic fallacy. Stars&mdash;are
they not matter, merely? They could not smile.</p>

<p>"Don't you truly think, Ambo," suggested Susan, "that
Jimmy ought to have a better chance? If he doesn't get
it, he'll have to work in a factory all his life. And here
I am&mdash;with you!"</p>

<p>"Yes. But consider, Susan&mdash;there are thousands of
boys like Jimmy. I can't father them all, you know."</p>

<p>"I don't want you to father them all," said Susan;
"and there isn't anybody like Jimmy! You'll see."</p>

<p>It came over me as she spoke that I was, however unwillingly,
predestined to see.</p>

<p>Maltby Phar thought otherwise. That night, after
Susan had gone up to bed, I talked the thing over with
him&mdash;trying for an airy, detached tone; the tone of one
who discusses an indifferent matter for want of a more
urgent. Maltby was not, I fear, deceived.</p>

<p>"My dear Boz," he pleaded, "buck up! Get a fresh
grip on your individuality and haul it back from the brink
of destruction! If you don't, that little she-demon above-stairs
will push it over into the gulf, once for all! You'll
be nobody. You'll be her dupe&mdash;her slave. How can you
smile, man! I'm quite serious, and I warn you. Fight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the good fight! Defend the supreme rights of your ego,
before it's too late!"</p>

<p>"Why these tragic accents?" I parried. "It's not
likely the washlady's kid would want to come; or his
mother let him. Susan idealizes him, of course. He's
probably quite commonplace and content as he is. No
harm, though, if it pleases Susan, in looking him over?"</p>

<p>Maltby took up his book again. He dismissed me.
"Whom the gods destroy&mdash;&mdash;" he muttered, and ostentatiously
turned a page.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>My feeling that I was predestined to see, with Susan,
that there wasn't anybody like Jimmy&mdash;that I was further
predestined to take him into my heart and home&mdash;proved,
very much to my own surprise and to the disappointment
of Susan, to be unjustified. This was the first
bitter defeat that Susan had been called upon to bear since
leaving Birch Street. She took it quietly, but deeply,
which troubled my private sense of relief, and indeed
turned it into something very like regret. The simple
fact was that much had happened in Birch Street since
the tragedy of the four-room house; life had not stood still
there; chance and change&mdash;deaths and marriages and
births&mdash;had altered the circumstances of whole families.
In short, that steady flux of mortality, which respects
neither the dignity of the Hillhouse Avenues nor the obscurity
of the Birch Streets of the world, had in its secret
courses already borne Jimmy Kane&mdash;elsewhere. Precisely
where, even his mother did not know; and first and
last it was her entire and passionate ignorance as to
Jimmy's present location which foiled us. "West" is a
geographical expression certainly, but it is not an address.</p>

<p>Jimmy's mother lived with her unwashed brood, you
will remember, above old Heinze's grocery store, and on
the following afternoon I ran Susan over there for a tactful
reconnaissance. At Susan's request we went slowly
along Birch Street from its extreme right end to its ultimate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
wrong, crossing the waste land and general dump at
the base of East Rock&mdash;historic ground!&mdash;mounting the
long incline beyond, and so passing the four-room house,
which now seemed to be occupied by at least three families
of that hardy, prolific race discourteously known to young
America as "wops." Throughout this little tour Susan
withdrew, and I respected her silence. She had not yet
spoken when we stopped at Heinze's corner and descended.</p>

<p>Here first it was that forebodings of chance and change
met us upon the pavement, in the person of old Heinze
himself, standing melancholy and pensive before the
screened doorway of his domain. Him Susan accosted.
He did not at first recognize her, but recollection returned
to him as she spoke.</p>

<p>"<i>Ach</i>, so!" he exclaimed, peering with mildest surprise
above steel-rimmed spectacles. "Id iss you&mdash;nod? Leedle
Susanna!"</p>

<p>My formal introduction followed; nor was it without
a glow of satisfaction that I heard old Heinze assure me
that he had read certain of my occasional essays with attention
and respect. "Ard for ard&mdash;yah! Dot iss your
credo," he informed me, with tranquil noddings of his
bumpy, oddly shaped skull. "Dot iss der credo of all
arisdograds. Id iss nod mine."</p>

<p>But Susan was in no mood for general ideas; she descended
at once to particulars, and announced that we
were going up to see Mrs. Kane. Then old Heinze snaggily,
and I thought rather wearily, smiled.</p>

<p>"<i>Aber</i>," he objected, lifting twisted, rheumatic hands,
"dere iss no more such a vooman! Alretty, leedle Susanna,
I haf peen an oldt fool like oders. I haf made her
my vife." And though he continued to smile, he also
sighed.</p>

<p>Our ensuing interview with Frau Heinze, formerly the
Widow Kane, fully interpreted this sigh. Prosperity,
Susan later assured me, had not improved her. She
greeted us, above the shop, in her small, shiny, colored<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
lithograph of a parlor, with unveiled suspicion. Her eyes
were hostile. She seemed to take it for granted, did Mrs.
Heinze, that we could have no kindly purpose in intruding
upon her. A dumpy, grumpy little woman, with the parboiled
hands and complexion of long years at the wash-tubs,
her present state of comparative freedom from bondage
had not lightened her heart. Her irritability, I told
Susan after our escape, was doubtless due to the fact
that she could not share in old Heinze's intellectual and
literary tastes. Susan laughed.</p>

<p>"She wouldn't bother much about that; Birch Street's
never lonely, and it's only a step to the State Street
movies. No; I think it's corsets."</p>

<p>Corsets? The word threw a flood of light. I saw at
once that it must be a strain upon any disposition to return
after a long and figureless widowhood to the steel,
buckram, and rebellious curves of conventional married
life. I remembered the harnesslike creaking of Mrs.
Heinze's waistline, and forgave her much.</p>

<p>There was really a good deal to forgive. It was neither
Susan's fault nor mine that turned our call into a bad
quarter of an hour. I had looked for a pretty scene as I
mounted the stairs behind Susan. I had pictured the
child, in her gay summer frock, bursting like sunshine
into Mrs. Heinze's stuffy quarters&mdash;and so forth. Nothing
of the kind occurred.</p>

<p>"Who is ut?" demanded Mrs. Heinze, peering forth.
"Oh, it's you&mdash;Bob Blake's girl. What do you want?"
Susan explained. "Well, come in then," said Mrs. Heinze.</p>

<p>Susan, less daunted than I by her reception, marched
in and asked at once for Jimmy. At the sound of his
name Mrs. Heinze's suspicions were sharply focused. If
the gentleman knew anything about Jimmy, all right, let
him say so! It wouldn't surprise her to hear he'd been
gettin' himself into trouble! It would surprise her much
more, she implied, if he had not. But if he had, she
couldn't be responsible&mdash;nor Heinze either, the poor man!
Jimmy was sixteen&mdash;a man grown, you might say. Let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
him look after himself, then; and more shame to him for
the way he'd acted!</p>

<p>But what way he had acted, and why, Susan at first
found it difficult to determine.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she at length protested, following cloudy suggestions
of evil courses. "Jimmy couldn't do anything
mean! You know he couldn't. It isn't in him!"</p>

<p>"Isn't ut indeed! Me slavin' for him and the
childer ever since Kane was took off sudden&mdash;and not a
cint saved for the livin'&mdash;let alone the dead! Slavin'
and worritin'&mdash;the way you'd think Jimmy'd 'a' jumped
wid joy when Heinze offered! And an easier man not to
be found&mdash;though he's got his notions. What man hasn't?
If it's not one thing, it's another. 'Except his beer, he
don't drink much,' I says to Jimmy; 'and that's more
than I could say for your own father, rest his soul!'
'My father wasn't a Dutchman,' Jimmy says; givin' me
his lip to me face. 'He didn't talk out against the Pope,'
he says. 'Nor the Pris'dint,' he says. 'He wasn't a stinkin'
Socialist,' he says&mdash;usin' them very words! 'No,' I
says, 'he was a Demycrat&mdash;and what's ut to you? All
men'll be blatherin' polytics after hours,' I says. 'Heinze
manes no harm by ut, no more nor the rest. 'Tis just his
talk,' I says. And after that we had more words, and I
laid me palm to his head."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Susan.</p>

<p>"I'll not take lip from a son of mine, Susan Blake;
nor from you, wid all your grand clothes! I've seen you
too often lackin' a modest stitch to your back!"</p>

<p>I hastened to intervene.</p>

<p>"We'll not trouble you longer, Mrs. Heinze, if you'll
only be good enough to tell me where Jimmy is now. He
was very kind to Susan once, and she wants to thank him
in some way. I've a proposition to make him&mdash;which
might be to his advantage."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;so that's ut at last! Well, Susan Blake, you've
had the grand luck for the likes of you! But you're too
late. Jimmy's gone."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gone?"</p>

<p>"'Tis the gratitude I get for raisin' him! Gone he
is, wid what he'd laid by&mdash;twinty-sivin dollars&mdash;and no
word to nobody. There's a son for ye!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;oh, Mrs. Heinze&mdash;gone <i>where?</i>"</p>

<p>"West. That's all I know," said Mrs. Heinze. "He
left a line to say he'd gone West. We've not had a scrap
from him since. If he comes to a bad end&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jimmy won't come to a bad end!" struck in Susan
sharply. "He did just right to leave you. Good-by."
With that she seized my arm and swept me with her from
the room.</p>

<p>"Glory be to God! Susan Blake&mdash;the airs of her now!"
followed us shrilly, satirically, down the stairs.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Maltby's visit came to an end, and for the first time I
did not regret his departure. For some reason, which perhaps
purposely I left unanalyzed, Maltby was beginning
to get a trifle on my nerves. But let that pass. Once he
was gone, Phil Farmer drew a long breath and plunged
with characteristic thoroughness into his comprehensive
scheme for the education of Susan. Her enthusiasm for
this scheme was no less contagious than his own, and I
soon found myself yielding to her wish to stay on in New
Haven through the summer, and let in for daily lessons at
regular hours&mdash;very much to my astonishment, the r&ocirc;le
of schoolmaster being one which I had always flattered myself
I was temperamentally unfitted to sustain.</p>

<p>I soon discovered, however, that teaching a mentally
alert, whimsically unexpected, stubbornly diligent, and
always grateful pupil is among the most stimulating and
delightful of human occupations. My own psychic laziness,
which had been long creeping upon me, vanished in
this new atmosphere of competition&mdash;competition, for that
is what it came to, with the unwearying Phil. It was a
real renascence for me. Forsaken gods! how I studied&mdash;off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
hours and on the sly! My French was excellent, my
Italian fair; but my small Latin and less Greek needed
endless attention. Yet I rather preen myself upon my
success; though Phil has always maintained that I overfed
Susan with &aelig;sthetic flummery, thus dulling the edge
of her appetite for his own more wholesome daily bread.</p>

<p>In one respect, at least, I disagreed fundamentally
with Phil, and here&mdash;through sheer force of conviction&mdash;I
triumphed. Phil, who lived exclusively in things of the
mind, would have turned this sensitive child into a bemused
scholar, a female bookworm. This, simply, I would
not and did not permit. If she had a soul, she had a body,
too, and I was determined that it should be a vigorous,
happy body before all else. For her sake solely&mdash;for I
am too easily an indolent man&mdash;I took up riding again,
and tennis, and even pushed myself into golf; with the
result that my nervous dyspepsia vanished, and my irritability
along with it; with the more excellent result that
Susan filled and bloomed and ate (for her) three really
astonishing meals a day.</p>

<p>It was a busy life&mdash;a wonderful life! Hard work&mdash;hard
play&mdash;fun&mdash;travel.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ah, those years!</p>

<p>But I am leaping ahead&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>Yet I have but one incident left to record of those
earliest days with Susan&mdash;an incident which had important,
though delayed, results&mdash;affecting in various ways,
for long unforeseen, Susan's career, and the destiny of several
other persons, myself among them.</p>

<p>Sonia, Susan's little Russian maid, was at the bottom
of it all; and the first hint of the rather sordid affair came
to me, all unprepared, from the lips of Miss Goucher. She
sought me out in my private study, whither I had retired
after dinner to write a letter or two&mdash;a most unusual
proceeding on her part, and on mine&mdash;and she asked
at once in her brief, hard, respectful manner for ten minutes
of my time. I rose and placed a chair for her, uncomfortably
certain that this could be no trivial errand; she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
seated herself, angularly erect, holding her feelings well
in hand.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hunt," she began, "have I your permission to discharge
Sonia?"</p>

<p>My face showed my surprise.</p>

<p>"But Susan likes her, doesn't she, Miss Goucher? And
she seems efficient?"</p>

<p>"Yes. A little careless perhaps; but then, she's young.
It isn't her service I object to."</p>

<p>"What is the trouble?"</p>

<p>"It is a question of character, Mr. Hunt. I have reason
to think her lacking in&mdash;self-respect."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;immoral?" I asked, using the word in the
restricted sense which I assumed Miss Goucher, like most
maiden ladies, exclusively attached to it. To my astonishment
Miss Goucher insisted upon more definition.</p>

<p>"No, I shouldn't say that. She tells a good many little
fibs, but she's not at heart dishonest. And I'm by no
means certain she can be held responsible for her weakness
in respect to men." A slight flush just tinged Miss Goucher's
prominent cheek bones; but duty was duty, and she
persevered. "She has a bad inheritance, I think; and until
she came here, Mr. Hunt, her environment was always&mdash;unfortunate.
If it were not for Susan, I shouldn't have
spoken. I should have felt it my duty to try to protect
the child and&mdash;&mdash; However," added Miss Goucher, "I
doubt whether much can be done for Sonia. So my first
duty is certainly to Miss Susan, and to you."</p>

<p>Susan's quiet admiration for Miss Goucher had more or
less puzzled me hitherto, but now my own opinion of Miss
Goucher soared heavenward. Why, the woman was remarkable&mdash;far
more so than I had remotely suspected!
She had a mind above her station, respectable though her
station might well be held to be.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Goucher," I exclaimed, "it is perfectly
evident to me that my interests are more than safe in
your keeping. Do what you think best, by all means!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Unfortunately, Mr. Hunt," said Miss Goucher, "that
is what I cannot do."</p>

<p>"May I ask why?"</p>

<p>"Society would not permit me," answered Miss Goucher.</p>

<p>"Please explain," I gasped.</p>

<p>"Sonia will cause a great deal of suffering in the world,"
said Miss Goucher, the color on her cheek bones deepening,
while she avoided my glance. "For herself&mdash;and
others. In my opinion&mdash;which I am aware is not widely
shared&mdash;she should be placed in a lethal chamber and painlessly
removed. We are learning to 'swat the fly,'" continued
Miss Goucher, "because it benefits no one and
spreads many human ills. Some day we shall learn to
swat&mdash;other things." Calmly she rose to take her leave.
Excitedly eager, I sprang up to detain her.</p>

<p>"Don't go, Miss Goucher! Your views are really most
interesting&mdash;though, as you say, not widely accepted.
Certainly not by me. Your plan of a lethal chamber for
weak sisters and brothers strikes me as&mdash;well, drastic. Do
sit down."</p>

<p>Again Miss Goucher perched primly upright on the
outer edge of the chair beside my own. "I felt bound
to state my views truthfully," she said, "since you asked
for them. But I never intrude them upon others. I'm
not a social rebel, Mr. Hunt. I lack self-confidence for
that. When I differ from the received opinion I always
suspect that I am quite wrong. Probably I am in this
case. But I think society would agree with me that Sonia
is not a fit maid for Susan."</p>

<p>"Beyond a shadow of doubt," I assented. "But may
I ask on what grounds you suspect Sonia?"</p>

<p>"It is certainly your right," replied Miss Goucher; "but
if you insist upon an answer I shall have to give notice."</p>

<p>"Then I shall certainly not insist."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Hunt," said Miss Goucher, rising once
more. "I appreciate this." And she walked from the
room.</p>

<p>It was the next afternoon that Susan burst into my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
study without knocking&mdash;a breach of manners which she
had recently learned to conquer, so the irruption surprised
me. But I noted instantly that Susan's agitation had carried
her far beyond all thought for trifles. Never had
I seen her like this. Her whole being was vibrant with
emotional stress.</p>

<p>"Ambo!" she cried, all but slamming the door behind
her. "Sonia mustn't go! I won't let her go! You and
Miss Goucher may think what you please&mdash;I won't, Ambo!
It's wicked! You don't want Sonia to be like Tilly Jaretski,
do you?"</p>

<p>"Like Tilly Jaretski?" My astonishment was so great
that I babbled the unfamiliar name merely to gain time,
collect my senses.</p>

<p>"Yes!" urged Susan, almost leaping to my side, and
seizing my arm with tense fingers. "She'll be just like
Tilly was, along State Street&mdash;after her baby came. Tilly
wasn't a bit like Pearl, Ambo; and Sonia isn't either! But
she's going to have a baby, too, Ambo, like Tilly."</p>

<p>With a wrench of my entire nervous system I, in one
agonizing second, completely dislocated the prejudices of
a lifetime, and rose to the situation confronting me. O
Hillhouse Avenue, right at both ends! How little you had
prepared me for this precocious knowledge of life&mdash;knowledge
that utterly degrades or most wonderfully saves&mdash;which
these children, out toward the wrong end of the
Birch Streets of the world, drink in almost with their
mothers' milk! How far I, a grown man&mdash;a cultured, sophisticated
man&mdash;must travel, Susan, even to begin to
equal your simple acceptance of naked, ugly fact&mdash;sheer
fact&mdash;seen, smelt, heard, tasted! How far&mdash;how far!</p>

<p>"Susan," I said gravely, "does Miss Goucher know
about Sonia?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I suppose so. I haven't seen her yet.
When Sonia came to me, crying&mdash;I ran straight in here!"</p>

<p>"And how long have <i>you</i> known?"</p>

<p>"Over a week. Sonia told me all about it, Ambo. Count
Dimbrovitski got her in trouble. She loved him, Ambo&mdash;her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
way. She doesn't any more. Sonia can't love anybody
long; he can't, either. That's why his wife sent
Sonia off. Sonia says she knows her husband's like that,
but so long as she can hush things up, she doesn't care.
Sonia says she has a lover herself, and Count Dim doesn't
care much either. Oh, Ambo&mdash;how <i>stuffy</i> some people are!
I don't mean Sonia. She's just pitiful&mdash;like Tilly. But
those others&mdash;they're different&mdash;I can feel it! Oh, how
<i>Artemis</i> must hate them, Ambo!"</p>

<p>Susan's tense fingers relaxed, slipping from my arm;
she slid down to the floor, huddled, and leaning against
the padded side of my chair buried her face in her hands.</p>

<p>Very quietly I rose, not to disturb her, and crossing
to the interphone requested Miss Goucher's presence. My
thoughts raced crazily on. In advance of Miss Goucher's
coming I had dramatized my interview with her in seven
different and unsatisfactory ways. When she at last entered,
my temple pulses were beating and my tongue was
stiff and dry. Susan, except for her shaken shoulders,
had not stirred.</p>

<p>"Miss Goucher," I managed to begin, "shut the door,
please.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You see this poor child&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Miss Goucher saw. Over her harsh, positive features
fell a sort of transforming veil. It seemed to me suddenly&mdash;if
for that moment only&mdash;that Miss Goucher was
very beautiful.</p>

<p>"If you wouldn't mind," she suggested, "leaving her
with me?"</p>

<p>Well, I had not in advance dramatized our meeting in
this way. In all the seven scenes that had flashed through
me, I had stood, an unquestioned star, at the center of the
stage. I had not foreseen an exit. But I most humbly and
gratefully accepted one now.</p>

<p>Precisely what took place, what words were said there,
in my study, following my humble exit, I have never
learned, either from Miss Goucher or from Susan. I know
only that from that hour forth the bond between them
became what sentimentalists fondly suppose the relationship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
between mother and daughter must always be&mdash;what,
alas, it so rarely, but then so beautifully, is.</p>

<p>I date from that hour Miss Goucher's abandonment of
her predilection for the lethal chamber; at least, she never
spoke of it again. And Sonia stayed with us. Her boy
was born in my house, and there for three happy years
was nourished and shamelessly spoiled; at the end of which
time Sonia found a husband in the person of young Jack
Palumbo, unquestionably the pick of all our Hillhouse
Avenue chauffeurs. Their marriage caused a brief scandal
in the neighborhood, but was soon accepted as an authentic
and successful fact.</p>

<p>Chance and change are not always villains, you observe;
the temperamental Sonia has grown stout and
placid, and has increased the world's legitimate population
by three. Nevertheless, it is the consensus of opinion that
little Ivan, her first-born, is the golden arrow in her quiver&mdash;an
opinion in which Jack Palumbo delightedly, if rather
surprisingly, concurs.</p>

<p>And so much for Sonia.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Let the curtain quietly descend.
When it rises again, six years will have passed;
good years&mdash;and therefore unrecorded. Your scribe,
Susan, is now nearing forty; and you&mdash;&mdash; Great heavens,
is it possible! Can you be "going on"&mdash;twenty?</p>

<p>Yes, dear&mdash;&mdash; You are.</p>

<h2>THE THIRD CHAPTER</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<div class='cap'>IT was October; the year, 1913. Susan, Miss Goucher
and I had just returned from Liverpool on the good
ship "Lusitania"&mdash;there was a good ship "Lusitania"
in those days&mdash;after a delightful summer spent in Italy
and France. Susan and I entirely agree that the season
for Italy is midsummer. Italy is not Italy until she has
drunk deep of the sun; until a haze of whitest dust floats
up from the slow hoofs of her white oxen along Umbrian
or Tuscan roads. You will never get from her churches
all they can give unless they have been to you as shadows
of great rocks in a weary land. To step from reverberating
glare to vast cool dimness&mdash;ah, that is to know at
last the meaning of sanctuary!</div>

<p>But to step from a North River pier into a cynical
taxi, solely energized by our great American principle
of "Take a chance!"&mdash;to be bumped and slithered by that
energizing principle across the main traffic streams of impatient
New York&mdash;that is to reawaken to all the doubt
and distraction, the implacable multiplicity of a scientifically
disordered world!</p>

<p>New Haven was better; Hillhouse Avenue preserving especially&mdash;through
valorous prodigies of rejection&mdash;much
of its ancient, slightly disdainful, studiously inconspicuous
calm.</p>

<p>Phil Farmer was waiting for us at the doorstep. For
all his inclusive greeting, his warm, welcoming smile, he
looked older, did Phil, leaner somehow, more finely drawn.
There was a something hungry about him&mdash;something in
his eyes. But if Susan, who notices most things, noted it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
she did not speak of her impression to me. She almost
hugged Phil as she jumped out to greet him and dragged
him with her up the steps to the door.</p>

<p>And now, if this portion of Susan's history is to be
truthfully recorded, certain facts may as well be set down
at once, clearly, in due order, without shame.</p>

<p>1. Phil Farmer was, by this time, hopelessly in love with
Susan.</p>

<p>2. So was Maltby Phar.</p>

<p>3. So was I.</p>

<p>It should now be possible for a modest but intelligent
reader to follow the approaching pages without undue
fatigue.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Susan never kept a diary, she tells me, but she had, like
most beginning authors, the habit of scribbling things
down, which she never intended to keep, and then could
seldom bring herself to destroy. To a writer all that his
pen leaves behind it seems sacred; it is, I treacherously
submit, a private grief to any of us to blot a line. Such
is our vanity. However inept the work which we force
ourselves or are prevailed upon to destroy, the unhappy
doubt always lingers: "If I had only saved it? One can't
be sure? Perhaps posterity&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Susan, thank God, was not and probably is not exempt
from this folly. It enables me from this time forward to
present certain passages&mdash;mere scraps and jottings&mdash;from
her notebooks, which she has not hesitated to turn over
to me.</p>

<p>"I don't approve, Ambo," was her comment, "but if you
<i>will</i> write nonsense about me, I can't help it. What I
can help, a little, is your writing nonsense about yourself
or Phil or the rest. It's only fair to let me get a word in
edgeways, now and then&mdash;if only for your sake and
theirs."</p>

<p>That is not, however, my own reason for giving you
occasional peeps into these notebooks of Susan's.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"I'm beginning to wish that Shelley might have had a
sense of humor. 'Epipsychidion' is really too absurd.
'Sweet benediction in the eternal curse!' Imagine, under
any condition of sanity, calling any woman that! Or
'Thou star above the storm!'&mdash;beautiful as the image is.
'Thou storm upon the star!' would make much worse
poetry, but much better sense.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Isn't it strange that
I can't feel this about Wordsworth? He was better off
without humor, for all his solemn-donkey spots&mdash;and it's
better for us that he didn't have it. It's probably better
for us, too, that Shelley didn't have it&mdash;but it wasn't better
for <i>him</i>. Diddle-diddle-dumpling&mdash;what stuff all this
is! Go to bed, Susan."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"There's no use pretending things are different, Susan
Blake; you might as well face them and see them through,
open-eyed. What does being in love mean?</p>

<p>"I suppose if one is really in love, head over heels, one
doesn't care what it means. But I don't like pouncing,
overwhelming things&mdash;things that crush and blast and
scorch and blind. I don't like cyclones and earthquakes
and conflagrations&mdash;at least, I've never experienced any,
but I know I shouldn't like them if I did. But I don't
think I'd be so terribly afraid of them&mdash;though I might.
I think I'd be more&mdash;sort of&mdash;indignant&mdash;disgusted."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Editor's Note: Such English! But pungent stylist as
Susan is now acknowledged to be, she is still, in the opinion
of academic critics, not sufficiently attentive to formal
niceties of diction. She remains too wayward, too impressionistic;
in a word, too personal. I am inclined to agree,
and yet&mdash;am I?</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"It's all very well to stamp round declaiming that
you're captain of your soul, but if an earthquake&mdash;even a
tiny one&mdash;comes and shakes your house like a dice box
and then scatters you and the family out of it like dice&mdash;it
wouldn't sound very appropriate for your epitaph. 'I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
am the master of my fate' would always look silly on a
tombstone. Why aren't tombstones a good test for poetry&mdash;some
poetry? I've never seen anything on a tombstone
that looked real&mdash;not even the names and dates.</p>

<p>"But <i>does</i> love have to be like an earthquake? If it
does, then it's just a blind force, and I don't like blind
forces. It's stupid to be blind oneself; but it's worse to
have blind stupid things butting into one and pushing one
about.</p>

<p>"Hang it, I don't believe love has to be stupid and
blind, and go thrashing through things! Ambo isn't
thrashing through things&mdash;or Phil either. But, of course,
they wouldn't. That's exactly what I mean about love;
it can be tamed, civilized. No, not civilized&mdash;just tamed.
<i>Cowed?</i> Then it's still as wild as ever underneath? I'm
afraid it is. Oh, dear!</p>

<p>"Phil and Ambo really are captains of their souls
though, so far as things in general let them be. <i>Things
in general</i>&mdash;what a funny name for God! But isn't God
just a short solemn name for things in general? There
I go again. Phil says I'm always taking God's name in
vain. He thinks I lack reverence. I don't, really. What
I lack is&mdash;reticence. That's different&mdash;isn't it, Ambo?"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The above extracts date back a little. The following
were jotted early in November, 1913, not long after our
return from overseas.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"This is growing serious, Susan Blake. Phil has asked
you to marry him, and says he needs you. Ditto Maltby;
only he says he wants you. Which, too obviously, he does.
Poor Maltby&mdash;imagine his trying to stoop so low as matrimony,
even to conquer! As for Ambo&mdash;Ambo says nothing,
bless him&mdash;but I think he wants and needs you most
of all. Well, Susan?"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Jimmy's back. I saw him yesterday. He didn't know
me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sex is a miserable nuisance. It muddles things&mdash;interferes
with honest human values. It's just Nature making
fools of us for her own private ends. These are not pretty
sentiments for a young girl, Susan Blake!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Speak up, Susan&mdash;clear the air! You are living here
under false pretenses. If you can't manage to feel like
Ambo's daughter&mdash;you oughtn't to stay."</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>It was perhaps when reticent Phil finally spoke to me
of his love for Susan that I first fully realized my own
predicament&mdash;a most unpleasant discovery; one which I
determined should never interfere with Susan's peace of
mind or with the possible chances of other, more eligible,
men. As Susan's guardian, I could not for a moment countenance
her receiving more than friendly attention from
a man already married, and no longer young. A grim,
confused hour in my study convinced me that I was an
impossible, even an absurd, <i>parti</i>. This conviction brought
with it pain so sharp, so nearly unendurable, that I wondered
in my weakness how it was to be unflinchingly borne.
Yet borne it must be, and without betrayal. It did not
occur to me, in my mature folly, that I was already,
and had for long been, self-betrayed.</p>

<p>"Steady, you old fool!" whispered my familiar demon.
"This isn't going to be child's play, you know. This is
an hour-by-hour torture you've set out to grin and bear
and live through. You'll never make the grade, if you
don't take cognizance in advance. The road's devilishly
steep and icy, and the corners are bad. What's more,
there's no end to it; the crest's never in sight. Clamp
your chains on and get into low.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Steady!</p>

<p>"But, of course," whispered my familiar demon,
"there's probably an easier way round. Why attempt the
impossible? Think what you've done for Susan! Gratitude,
my dear sir&mdash;affectionate gratitude&mdash;is a long step<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
in the right direction .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if it is the right direction. I
don't say it is; I merely suggest, <i>en passant</i>, that it may
be. Suppose, for example, that Susan&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Damn you!" I spat out, jumping from my chair.
"You contemptible swine!"</p>

<p>Congested blood whined in my ears like a faint jeering
laughter. I paced the room, raging&mdash;only to sink down
again, exhausted, my face and hands clammy.</p>

<p>"What a hideous exhibition," I said, distinctly addressing
a grotesque porcelain Buddha on the mantelpiece.
Contrary, I believe, to my expectations, he did not reply.
My familiar demon forestalled him.</p>

<p>"If by taking a merely conventional attitude," he murmured,
"you defeat the natural flowering of two lives&mdash;&mdash;?
Who are you to decide that the voice of Nature is not also
the voice of God? Supposing, for the moment, that God is
other than a poetic expression. If her eyes didn't haunt
you," continued my familiar demon, "or a certain way
she has of turning her head, like a poised poppy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>As he droned on within me, the mantelpiece blurred and
thinned to the blue haze of a distant Tuscan hill, and the
little porcelain Buddha sat upon this hill, very far off now
and changed oddly to the semblance of a tiny huddled
town. We were climbing along a white road toward that
far hill, that tiny town.</p>

<p>"Ambo," she was saying, "that isn't East Rock&mdash;it's
Monte Senario. And this isn't Birch Street&mdash;it's the
Faenzan Way. How do you do it, Ambo&mdash;you wonderful
magician! Just with a wave of your wand you change the
world for me; you give me&mdash;all this!"</p>

<p>A bee droned at my ear: "Gratitude, my dear sir.
Affectionate gratitude. A long step."</p>

<p>"Damn you!" I whimpered.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But the grotesque porcelain
Buddha was there again, on the mantelshelf. The
creases in his little fat belly disgusted me; they were loathsome.
I rose. "At least," I said to him, "I can live
without <i>you!</i>" Then I seized him and shattered him
against the fireplace tiles. It was an enormous relief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Followed a knock at my door that I answered calmly:
"Who is it? Come in."</p>

<p>Miss Goucher never came to me without a mission; she
had one now.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hunt," she said, "I should like to talk to you
very plainly. May I? It's about Susan." I nodded.
"Mr. Hunt," she continued resolutely, "Susan is in a
very difficult position here. I don't say that she isn't
entirely equal to meeting it; but I dread the nervous strain
for her&mdash;if you understand?"</p>

<p>"Not entirely, Miss Goucher; perhaps, not at all."</p>

<p>"I was afraid of this," she responded unhappily. "But
I must go on&mdash;for her sake."</p>

<p>Knowing well that Miss Goucher would face death smiling
for Susan's sake, her repressed agitation alarmed me.
"Good heavens!" I exclaimed. "Is there anything really
wrong?"</p>

<p>"A good deal." She paused, her lips whitening as she
knit them together, lest any ill-considered word should
slip from her. Miss Goucher never loosed her arrows at
random; she always tried for the bull's-eye, and usually
with success.</p>

<p>"I am speaking in strict confidence&mdash;to Susan's protector
and legal guardian. Please try to fill in what I leave
unsaid. It is very unfortunate for Susan's peace of mind
that you should happen to be a married man."</p>

<p>"For <i>her</i> peace of mind!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Wait! I daren't trust myself to fill in what you leave
unsaid. It's too&mdash;preposterous. Do you mean&mdash;&mdash; But
you can't mean that you imagine Susan to be in love with&mdash;her
grandfather?" My heart pounded, suffocating me;
with fright, I think.</p>

<p>"No," said Miss Goucher, coldly; "Susan is not in
love with her grandfather. She is with you."</p>

<p>I could manage no response but an angry one. "That's
a dangerous statement, Miss Goucher! Whether true or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
not&mdash;it ruins everything. You have made our life here
together impossible."</p>

<p>"It is impossible," said Miss Goucher. "It became so
last summer. I knew then it could not go on much longer."</p>

<p>"But I question this! I deny that Susan feels for me
more than&mdash;gratitude and affection."</p>

<p>"Gratitude is rare," said Miss Goucher enigmatically,
her eyes fixed upon the fragments of Buddha littering
my hearth. "True gratitude," she added, "is a strong
emotion. When it passes between a man and a woman,
it is like flame."</p>

<p>"Very interesting!" I snapped. "But hardly enough
to have brought you here to me with this!"</p>

<p>"She feels that you need her," said Miss Goucher.</p>

<p>"I do," was my reply.</p>

<p>"Susan doesn't need <i>you</i>," said Miss Goucher. "I
don't wish to be brutal; but she doesn't. In spite of this,
she can easily stand alone."</p>

<p>"I see. And you think that would be best?"</p>

<p>"Naturally. Don't you?"</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure."</p>

<p>As I muttered this my eyes, too, fixed themselves on the
fragments of Buddha. Would the woman never go! I
hated her; it seemed to me now that I had always hated
her. What was she after all but a superior kind of servant&mdash;presuming
in this way! The irritation of these thoughts
swung me suddenly round to wound her, if I might, with
sarcasm, with implied contempt. But it is impossible to
wound the air. With her customary economy of explanation
Miss Goucher had, pitilessly, left me to myself.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The evening of this already comfortless day I now recall
as one of the most exasperating of my life. Maltby
Phar arrived for dinner and the week-end&mdash;an exasperation
foreseen; Phil came in after dinner&mdash;another; but
what I did not foresee was that Lucette Arthur would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
bring her malicious self and her unspeakably tedious husband
for a formal call. Lucette was an old friend of
Gertrude, and I always suspected that her occasional
evening visits were followed by a detailed report; in fact,
I rather encouraged them, and returned them promptly,
hoping that they were. In my harmless way of life even
Lucette's talent for snooping could find, I felt, little to
feed upon, and it did not wholly displease me that Gertrude
should be now and then forced to recognize this.</p>

<p>The coming of Susan had, not unnaturally, for a time,
provided Lucette with a wealth of interesting conjecture;
she had even gone so far as to intimate that Gertrude
felt I was making&mdash;the expression is entirely mine&mdash;an ass
of myself, which neither surprised nor disturbed me, since
Gertrude had always had a tendency to feel that my talents
lay in that direction. But, on the whole, up to this
time&mdash;barring the Sonia incident, which had afforded her a
good deal of scope, but which, after all, could not be
safely misinterpreted&mdash;Lucette had found at my house
pretty thin pickings for scandal; and I could only wonder
at the unwearying patience with which she pursued her
quest.</p>

<p>She arrived with poor Doctor Arthur in tow&mdash;Dr. Lyman
Arthur, who professed Primitive Eschatology in the
School of Religion: eschatology being "that branch of theology
which treats of the end of the world and man's
condition or state after death"&mdash;just upon the heels of
Phil, who shot me a despairing glance as we rose to greet
them.</p>

<p>But Susan, I thought, welcomed them with undisguised
relief. She had been surpassing herself before the fire,
chatting blithely, wittily, even a little recklessly; but there
are gayer evenings conceivable than one spent in the presence
of three doleful men, two of whom have proposed
marriage to you, and one of whom would have done so if
he were not married already. Almost anything, even
open espionage and covert eschatology, was better than
that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Lucette&mdash;the name suggests Parisian vivacity, but she
was really large and physically languid and very blonde,
scented at once, I felt, a something faintly brimstoneish
in the atmosphere of my model home, and forthwith prepared
herself for a protracted and pleasant evening. It
so happened that the Arthurs had never met Maltby, and
Susan carried through the ceremony of introduction with
a fine swinging rhythm which settled us as one group before
the fire and for some moments at least kept the conversation
animated and general.</p>

<p>But Eschatology, brooding in the background, soon put
an end to this somewhat hectic social burst. The mere
unnoted presence of Dr. Lyman Arthur, peering nearsightedly
in at the doorway on a children's party, has
been known, I am told, to slay youngling joy and turn
little tots self-conscious, so that they could no longer be
induced by agonized mothers to go to Jerusalem, or clap-in
clap-out. His presence now, gradually but surely, had
much the same effect. Seated at Maltby's elbow, he passed
into the silence and drew us, struggling but helpless, after
him. For five horrible seconds nothing was heard but the
impolite, ironic whispering of little flames on the hearth.
Was this man's condition or state after death? Eschatology
had conquered.</p>

<p>Susan, in duty bound as hostess, broke the spell, but
it cannot be said she rose to the occasion. "Is it a party
in a parlor," she murmured wistfully to the flames, "all
silent and all&mdash;damned?"</p>

<p>Perceiving that Lucette supposed this to be original
sin, I laughed much more loudly than cheerfully, exclaiming
"Good old Wordsworth!" as I did so.</p>

<p>Then Maltby's evil genius laid hold on him.</p>

<p>"By the way," he snorted, "they tell me one of you
academic ghouls has discovered that Wordsworth had an
illegitimate daughter&mdash;whatever <i>that</i> means! Any truth
in it? I hope so. It's the humanest thing I ever heard
about the old sheep!"</p>

<p>Doctor Arthur cleared his throat, very cautiously; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
it was evident that Maltby had not helped us much. Phil,
in another vein, helped us little more.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he asked, "if anyone reads Wordsworth
now&mdash;except Susan?"</p>

<p>No one, not even Susan, seemed interested in this question;
and the little flames chuckled quietly once more.</p>

<p>Something had to be done.</p>

<p>"Doctor," I began, turning toward Eschatology, and
knowing no more than my Kazak hearthrug what I was
going to say, "is it true that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," intoned Eschatology, thereby saving
me from the pit I was digging for myself. My incomplete
question must have chimed with Doctor Arthur's private
reflections, and he seemed to suppose some controversial
matter under discussion. "Undoubtedly," he repeated.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
"And what is even more important is this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Lucette silenced him with a "Why is it, dear, that
you always let your cigar burn down at one side? It does
look so untidy." And she leaned to me. "What delightfully
daring discussions you must all of you have here together!
You're all so terribly intellectual, aren't you?
But do you never talk of anything but books and art and
ideas? I'm sure you must," she added, fixing me with
impenetrable blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Often," I smiled back; "even the weather has charms
for us. Even food."</p>

<p>Her inquisitive upper lip curled and dismissed me.</p>

<p>"Why is it," she demanded, turning suddenly on Susan,
"that I don't see you round more with the college boys?
They're much more suitable to your age, you know, than
Ambrose or Phil. I hope you don't frighten them off, my
dear, by mentioning Wordsworth? Boys dislike bluestockings;
and you're much too charming to wear them anyway.
Oh, but you really are! I must take charge of you&mdash;get
you out more where you belong, away from these dreadful
old fogies!" Lucette laughed her languid, purring, dangerous
laughter. "I'm serious, Miss Blake. You musn't
let them monopolize you; they will if you're not careful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
They're just selfish enough to want to keep you to themselves."</p>

<p>The tone was badinage; but the remark struck home
and left us speechless. Lucette shifted the tiller slightly
and filled her sails. "Next thing you know, Miss Blake,
they'll be asking you to marry them. Individually, of
course&mdash;not collectively. And, of course&mdash;not Ambrose!
At least you're safe there," she hastily added; "aren't
you?"</p>

<p>Maltby, I saw, was furious; bent on brutalities. Before
I could check him, "Why?" he growled. "Why, Mrs.
Arthur, do you assume that Susan is safe with Boz?"</p>

<p>"Well," she responded with a slow shrug of her
shoulders, "naturally&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unnaturally!" snapped Maltby. "Unless forbidden
fruit has ceased to appeal to your sex. I was not aware
that it had."</p>

<p>Phil's eyes were signalling honest distress. Susan unexpectedly
rose from her chair. Deep spots of color burned
on her cheeks, but she spoke with dignity. "I have never
disliked any conversation so much, Mrs. Arthur. Good
night." She walked from the room. Phil jumped up
without a word and hurried after her. Then we all rose.</p>

<p>It seemed, however, that apologies were useless. Doctor
Arthur had no need for them, since he had not perceived
a slight, and was only too happy to find himself
released from bondage; as for Lucette, her assumed frigidity
could not conceal her flaming triumph. As a social
being, for the sake of the <i>mores</i>, she must resent Susan's
snub; but I saw that she would not have had things happen
otherwise for a string of matched pearls. At last, at last
her patience had been rewarded! I could almost have
written for her the report to Gertrude&mdash;with nothing explicitly
stated, and nothing overlooked.</p>

<p>Maltby, after their departure, continued truculent, and
having no one else to rough-house decided to rough-house
me. The lengthening absence of Susan and Phil had much
to do with his irritation, and something no doubt with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
mine. For men of mature years we presently developed
a very pretty little gutter-snipe quarrel.</p>

<p>"Damn it, Boz," he summed his grievances, "it comes
precisely to this: You're playing dog in the manger
here. By your attitude, by every kind of sneaking suggestion,
you poison Susan's mind against me. Hang it, I'm
not vain&mdash;but at least I'm presentable, and I've been called
amusing. Other women have found me so. And to speak
quite frankly, it isn't every man in my position who would
offer marriage to a girl whose father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'd stop there, Maltby, if I were you!"</p>

<p>"My dear man, you and I are above such prejudices,
of course! But it's only common sense to acknowledge
that they exist. Susan's the most infernally seductive
accident that ever happened on this middle-class planet!
But all the same, there's a family history back of her that
not one man in fifty would be able to forget. My point
is, that with all her seduction, physical and mental, she's
not in the ordinary sense marriageable. And it's the
ordinary sense of such things that runs the world."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;there you are! I offer her far more than she
could reasonably hope for; or you for her. I'm well fixed,
I know everybody worth knowing; I can give her a good
time, and I can help her to a career. It strikes me that if
you had Susan's good at heart, you'd occasionally suggest
these thing's to her&mdash;even urge them upon her. As her
guardian you must have some slight feeling of responsibility?"</p>

<p>"None whatever."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"None whatever&mdash;so far as Susan's deeper personal life
is concerned. That is her affair, not mine."</p>

<p>"Then you'd be satisfied to have her throw herself
away?"</p>

<p>"If she insisted, yes. But Susan's not likely to throw
herself away."</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't she! Let me tell you this, Boz, once for all:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
You're in love with the girl yourself, and though you may
not know it, you've no intention of letting anyone else
have a chance."</p>

<p>"Well," I flashed, "if you were in my shoes&mdash;would
<i>you?</i>"</p>

<p>The vulgarity of our give and take did not escape me,
but in my then state of rage I seemed powerless to escape
vulgarity. I revelled in vulgarity. It refreshed me. I
could have throttled Maltby, and I am quite certain he was
itching to throttle me. We were both longing to throttle
Phil. Indeed, we almost leaped at him as he stopped in
the hall doorway to toss us an unnaturally gruff good
night.</p>

<p>"Where's Susan?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"In your study," Phil mumbled, hunching into his overcoat;
"she's waiting to see you." Then he seized his
shapeless soft hat and&mdash;the good old phrase best describes
it&mdash;made off.</p>

<p>"She's got to see me first!" Maltby hurled at me,
coarsely, savagely, as he started past.</p>

<p>I grabbed his arm and held him. It thrilled me to realize
how soft he was for all his bulk, to feel that physically
I was the stronger.</p>

<p>"Wait!" I said. "This sort of thing has gone far
enough. We'll stop <i>grovelling</i>&mdash;if you don't mind! If
we can't give Susan something better than this, we've
been cheating her. It's a pity she ever left Birch Street."</p>

<p>Maltby stared at me with slowly stirring comprehension.</p>

<p>"Yes," he at length muttered, grudgingly enough; "perhaps
you're right. It's been an absurd spectacle all round.
But then, life is."</p>

<p>"Wait for me here," I responded. "We'll stop butting
at each other like stags, and try to talk things over like
men. I'm just going to send Susan to bed."</p>

<p>That <i>was</i> my intention. I went to her in the study as a
big brother might go, meaning good counsel. It was certainly
not my intention to let her run into my arms and
press her face to my shoulder. She clung to me with passion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
but without joy, and her voice came through the
tumult of my senses as if from a long way off.</p>

<p>"Ambo, Ambo! You've asked nothing&mdash;and you want
me most of all. I <i>must</i> make somebody happy!"</p>

<p>It was the voice of a child.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>I could not face Maltby again that evening, as I had
promised, for our good sensible man-to-man talk; a lapse
in courage which reduced him to rabid speculation and
restless fury. So furious was he, indeed, after a long hour
alone, that he telephoned for a taxi, grabbed his suitcase,
and caught a slow midnight local for New York&mdash;from
which electric center he hissed back over the wires three
ominous words to ruin my solitary breakfast:</p>

<div class='center'>
"He laughs best&mdash;&mdash;   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      <span class="smcap">M. Phar</span>."<br />
</div>

<p>While my egg solidified and the toast grew rigid I meditated
a humble apologetic reply, but in the end I could
not with honesty compose one; though I granted him just
cause for anger. With that, for the time being, I dismissed
him. There were more immediate problems, threatening,
inescapable, that must presently be solved.</p>

<p>Susan, always an early riser, usually had a bite of breakfast
at seven o'clock&mdash;brought to her by the faithful Miss
Goucher&mdash;and then remained in her room to work until
lunch time. For about a year past I had so far caught the
contagion of her example as to write in my study three
hours every morning; a regularity I should formerly have
despised. Dilettantism always demands a fine frenzy, but
now it astounded me to discover how much respectable
writing one could do without waiting for the spark from
heaven; one could pass beyond the range of an occasional
article and even aspire to a book. Only the final pages
of my first real book&mdash;<i>Aristocracy and Art</i>, an essay in
&aelig;sthetic and social criticism&mdash;remained to be written; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Susan had made me swear by the Quanglewangle's Hat,
her favorite symbol, to push on with it each morning till
the job was done.</p>

<p>Well, <i>Aristocracy and Art</i> has since been published and,
I am glad to say, forgotten. Conceived in superciliousness
and swaddled in preciosity, it is one of the sins I now
strive hardest to expiate. But in those days it expressed
clearly enough the crusted aridity of my soul. However&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I had hoped, of course, that Susan would break over
this morning and breakfast with me. She did not; and
from sheer habit I took to my study and found myself in
the chair before my desk. It was my purpose to think
things out, and perhaps that is what I supposed myself
to be doing as I stared dully at an ink blob on my blotter.
It looked&mdash;and I was idiotically pleased by the resemblance&mdash;rather
like a shark. All it needed was some teeth
and a pair of flukes for its tail. Methodically I opened my
fountain pen and supplied these, thereby reducing one
fragment of chaos to order; and then my eye fell upon
a half-scribbled sheet, marked "Page 224."</p>

<p>The final sentence on the sheet caught at me and annoyed
me; it was ill-constructed. Presently it began to
rearrange itself in whatever portion of us it is that these
shapings and reshapings take place. Something in its
rhythm, too, displeased me; it was mannered; it minuetted;
it echoed Pater at his worst. It should be simpler,
stronger. Why, naturally! I lopped at it, compressed it,
pulled it about.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>There! At last the naked idea got the clean expression
it deserved; and it led now directly to a brief, clear paragraph
of transition. I had been worrying over that transition
the morning before when my pen stopped; now it
came with a smooth rush, carrying me forward and on.</p>

<p>Incredible, but for one swiftly annihilated hour I forgot
all my insoluble life problems! Art, that ancient Circe,
had waved her wand; I was happy&mdash;and it was enough.
I forgot even Susan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Susan, busy at her notebook, had all but
forgotten me.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Am I in love with Ambo, or am I just trying to be for
his sake? If happiness is a test, then I can't be in love
with him, for there is no happiness in me. But what has
happiness to do with love? It's just as I told nice old
Phil last night. To be in love is to be silly enough to suppose
that some other silly can gather manna for you from
the meadows of heaven. Meanwhile, the other silly is
supposing much the same nonsense about you&mdash;or if he
isn't, then the sun goes black. What lovers seem to value
most in each other is premature softening of the brain.
But surely the union of two vain hopes in a single disappointment
can never mean joy? No. You might as well
get it said, Susan. Love is two broken reeds trying to be
a Doric column.</p>

<p>"Still, there must be some test. Is it passion? How
can it be?</p>

<p>"When I ran to Ambo last night I was pure rhythm
and flame; but this morning I'm the hour before sunrise.
No; I'm the outpost star, the one the comets turn&mdash;the
one that peers off into nowhere.</p>

<p>"Perhaps if Ambo came to me now I should flame
again; or perhaps I should only make believe for his
sake. Is wanting to make believe for another's sake
enough? Why not? I've no patience with lovers who are
always rhythm and flame. Even if they exist&mdash;outside of
<i>maisons de sant&eacute;</i>&mdash;what good are they? Poets can rave
about them, I suppose&mdash;that's something; but imagine coming
to the end of life and finding that one had merely
furnished good copy for Swinburne! No, thank you, Mrs.
Heph&aelig;stus&mdash;you beautiful, shameless humbug! I prefer
Apollo's lonely magic to yours. I'd rather be Swinburne
than Iseult. If there's any singing left to be done I shall
try to do part of it myself.</p>

<p>"There, you see; already you've forgotten Ambo completely&mdash;now
you'll have to turn back and hunt for him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
And if he's really working on <i>Aristocracy and Art</i> this
morning, as he should be, then he has almost certainly forgotten
you. Oh, dear! but he isn't&mdash;and he hasn't! Here
he comes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Yes, I came; but not to ask for assurances of love. Man
is so na&iuml;vely egotist, it takes a good deal to convince him,
once the idea has been accepted, that he is not the object of
an unalterable devotion. Frankly, I took it for granted now
that Susan loved me, and would continue to love me till her
dying hour.</p>

<p>What I really came to say to her, under the calming
and strengthening influence of two or three rather well-written
pages, was that our situation had definitely become
untenable. I am an emancipated talker, but I am not
an emancipated man; the distinction is important; the
hold of mere custom upon me is strong. I could not see
myself asking Susan to defy the world with me; or if I
could just see it for my own sake, I certainly couldn't for
hers. Nor could I see it for Gertrude's. Gertrude, after
all, was my wife; and though she chose to feel I had driven
her from my society, I knew that she did not feel willing
to seek divorce for herself or to grant the freedom of it to
me. On this point her convictions, having a religious sanction,
were permanent. Gentle manners, then, if nothing
higher, forbade me to seize the freedom she denied me.
Having persuaded Gertrude, in good faith, to enter into
an unconditional contract with me for life, I could no more
bring myself to break it than I could have forced myself
to steal another's money by raising a check.</p>

<p>My New England ancestors had distilled into my blood
certain prejudices; only, where my great-grandfather, or
even my grandfather, would have said that he refrained
from evil because he feared God, I was content merely to
feel that there are some things a gentleman doesn't stoop
to. With them it was the stern daughter of the voice of
God who ruled thoughts and acts; with me it was, if anything,
the class obligations of culture, breeding, good form.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Just as I wore correct wedding garments at a wedding,
and would far rather have cut my throat with a knife than
carry food on it from plate to mouth, so, in the face of any
of life's moral or emotional crises, I clung to what instinct
and cultivation told me were the correct sentiments.</p>

<p>Gertrude, it is true, was not precisely fulfilling her part
in our contract, but then&mdash;Gertrude was a woman; and
the excusable frailties of women should always be regarded
as trumpet calls to the chivalry of man. Absurdly primitive,
such ideas as these! Seated with Maltby Phar in
my study, I had laughed them out of court many a time;
for I could talk pure Bernard Shaw&mdash;our prophet of those
days&mdash;with anybody, and even go him one better. But
when it came to the pinch of decisive action I had always
thrown back to my sources and left the responsibility on
them. I did so now.</p>

<p>Yet it was hard to speak of anything but enchantment,
witchery, fascination, when, from her desk, Susan looked
round to me, faintly puzzled, faintly smiling. She was
not a pretty girl, as young America&mdash;its taste superbly
catered to by popular magazines&mdash;understands that
phrase; nor was she beautiful by any severe classic standard&mdash;unless
you are willing to accept certain early Italians
as having established classic standards; not such faultless
painters as Raphael or Andrea del Sarto, but three or four
of the wayward lesser men whose strangely personal vision
created new and unexpected types of loveliness. Not that
I recall a single head by any one of them that prefigured
Susan; not that I am helping you, baffled reader, to see
her. Words are a dull medium for portraiture, or I am
too dull a dog to catch with them even a phantasmal <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'likeless'">likeness</ins>.
It is the mixture of dark and bright in Susan that
eludes me; she is all soft shadow and sharpest gleams.
But that is nonsense. I give it up.</p>

<p>It was really, then, a triumph for my ancestors that I
did not throw myself on my knees beside her chair&mdash;the
true romantic attitude, when all's said&mdash;and draw her
dark-bright face down to mine. I halted instead just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
within the doorway, retaining a deathlike grip on the door-knob.</p>

<p>"Dear," I blurted, "it won't do. It's the end of the
road. We can't go on."</p>

<p>"Can we turn back?" asked Susan.</p>

<p>I wonder the solid bronze knob did not shatter like hollow
glass in my hand.</p>

<p>"You must help me," I muttered.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Susan, all quiet shadow now, gleamless;
"I'll help you."</p>

<p>Half an hour after I left her she telephoned and dispatched
the following telegram, signed "Susan Blake,"
to Gertrude at her New York address:</p>

<div class='center'>
"<i>Either come back to him or set him free. Urgent.</i>"<br />
</div>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The reply&mdash;a note from Gertrude, the ink hardly dry on
it, written from the Egyptian tomb of the Misses Carstairs&mdash;came
directly to me that evening; and Mrs. Parrot was
the messenger. Her expression, as she mutely handed me
the note, was ineffable. I read the note with sensations of
suffocation; an answer was requested.</p>

<p>"Tell Mrs. Hunt," I said firmly to Mrs. Parrot, "that
it was she who left me, and I am stubbornly determined
to make no advances. If she cares to see me I shall be glad
to see her. She has only to walk a few yards, climb a few
easy steps, and ring the bell."</p>

<p>My courtesy was truly elaborate as I conducted Mrs.
Parrot to the door. Her response was disturbing.</p>

<p>"It's not for me to make observations," said Mrs. Parrot,
"the situation being delicate, and not likely to improve.
But if I was you, Mr. Hunt, I'd not be too stiff.
No; I'd not be. I would not. No. Not if I valued the
young lady's reputation."</p>

<p>Like the Pope's mule, Mrs. Parrot had saved her kick
many years. I can testify to its power.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Thirty minutes later this superkick landed me, when
I came crashing back to earth, at the door of the Egyptian
tomb.</p>

<p>"How hard it is," says Dante, "to climb another's
stairs," and he might have added to ring another's bell,
under certain conditions of spiritual humiliation and stress.
Thank the gods&mdash;all of them&mdash;it was not Mrs. Parrot who
admitted me and took my card!</p>

<p>I waited miserably in the large, ill-lighted reception
vault of the tomb, which smelt appropriately of lilies, as
if the undertaker had recently done his worst. How well
I remembered it, how long I had avoided it! It was here
of all places, under the contemptuous eye of old Ephraim
Carstairs, grim ancestral founder of this family's fortunes,
that Gertrude had at last consented to be my wife. And
there he still lorded it above the fireplace, unchanged, glaring
down malignantly through the shadows, his stiff neck
bandaged like a mummy's, his hard, high cheek bones and
cavernous eyes making him the very image of bugaboo
death. What an eavesdropper for the approaching reconciliation;
for that was what it had come to. That was
what it would have to be!</p>

<p>It was not Gertrude who came down to me; it was
Lucette. Lucette&mdash;all graciousness, all sympathetic understanding,
all feline smiles! Dear Gertrude had 'phoned
her on arriving, and she had rushed to her at once! Dear
Gertrude had such a desperate headache! She couldn't
possibly see me to-night. She was really ill, had been growing
rapidly worse for an hour. Perhaps to-morrow?</p>

<p>I was in no mood to be tricked by this stale subterfuge.</p>

<p>"See here, Lucette," I said sternly, "I'm not going to
fence with you or fool round at cross purposes. Less than
an hour ago Gertrude sent over a note, asking me to call."</p>

<p>"To which you returned an insufferable verbal reply."</p>

<p>"A bad-tempered reply, I admit. No insult was intended.
And I've come now to apologize for the temper."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" sighed Lucette. "Men always do their
thinking too late. I wish I could reassure you; but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
mischief seems to be done. Poor Gertrude is furious."</p>

<p>"Then the headache is&mdash;hypothetical?"</p>

<p>"An excuse, you mean? I wish it were, for her sake!"
Lucette's eyes positively caressed me, as a tiger might lick
the still-warm muzzle of an antelope, its proximate meal.
"If you could see her face, poor creature! She's in torment."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Isn't that&mdash;what you called her headache?"</p>

<p>"No. I'm ashamed of my boorishness. Let me see Gertrude
and tell her so."</p>

<p>Lucette smiled, slightly shaking her head. "Impossible&mdash;till
she's feeling better. And not then&mdash;unless she
changes her mind. You see, Ambrose, Mrs. Parrot's version
of your reply was the last straw."</p>

<p>"No doubt she improved on the original," I muttered.</p>

<p>"Oh, no doubt," agreed Lucette calmly. "She would.
It was silly of you not to think of that."</p>

<p>"Yes," I snapped. "Men always underestimate a
woman's malice."</p>

<p>"They have so many distractions, poor dears. Men, I
mean. And we have so few. You can put that in your next
article, Ambrose?" She straightened her languid curves
deliberately, as if preparing to rise.</p>

<p>"Please!" I exclaimed. "I'm not ready for dismissal
yet. We'll get down to facts, if you don't mind. Why is
Gertrude here at all? After years of silence? Did you
send for her?"</p>

<p>Lucette's spine slowly relaxed, her shoulders drooped
once more. "I? My dear Ambrose, why on earth should
I do a thing like that?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. The point is, did you?"</p>

<p>"You think it in character?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;be candid! I don't mean directly, of course.
But is she here because of anything you may have telephoned
her&mdash;after your call last night?"</p>

<p>"Really, Ambrose! This is a little too much, even from
you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Forgive me&mdash;I insist! Is she?"</p>

<p>"You must have a very bad conscience," replied Lucette.</p>

<p>"I am more interested in yours."</p>

<p>She laughed luxuriously, "Mine has never been clearer."</p>

<p>Did the woman want me to stop her breath with bare
hands? I gripped the mahogany arms of my stiff Chippendale
chair.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Lucette! I know this is all very thrilling
and amusing for you. Vivisection must have its
charms, of course&mdash;for an expert. But I venture to remind
you that once upon a time you were not a bad-hearted
girl, and you must have some remnants of human
sympathy about you somewhere. Am I wrong?"</p>

<p>"You're hideously rude."</p>

<p>"Granted. But I must place you. I won't accept you
as an onlooker. Either you'll fight me or help me&mdash;or
clear out. Is that plain?"</p>

<p>"You're worse than rude," said Lucette; "you're a
beast! I always wondered why Gertrude couldn't live
with you. Now I know."</p>

<p>"That's better," I hazarded. "We're beginning to
understand each other. Now let's lay all our cards face up
on the table?"</p>

<p>Lucette stared at me a moment, her lips pursed, dubious,
her impenetrable blue eyes holding mine.</p>

<p>"I will, if you will," she said finally. "Let's."</p>

<p>It was dangerous, I knew, to take her at her word; yet
I ventured.</p>

<p>"I've a weak hand, Lucette; but there's one honest ace
of trumps in it."</p>

<p>"There could hardly be two," smiled Lucette.</p>

<p>"No; I count on that. In a pinch, I shall take the one
trick essential, and throw the others away." I leaned to
her and spoke slowly: "There is no reason, affecting her
honor or rights, why Gertrude may not return to her home&mdash;if
she so desires. I think you understand me?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly. You wish to protect Miss Blake. You
would try to do that in any case, wouldn't you? But I'm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
rather afraid you're too late. I'm afraid Miss Blake has
handicapped you too heavily. If so, it was clever of her&mdash;for
she must have done it on purpose. You see, Ambrose,
it was she who sent for Gertrude."</p>

<p>"Susan!"</p>

<p>"Susan. Telegraphed her&mdash;of all things!&mdash;either to
come home to you or set you free. The implication's transparent.
Especially as I had thought it my duty to warn
Gertrude in advance&mdash;and as Mr. Phar sent her, by messenger,
a vague but very disturbing note this morning."</p>

<p>"Maltby?"</p>

<p>"Yes. His note was delivered not five minutes ahead of
Susan's wire. Gertrude caught the next train. And there
you are."</p>

<p>Well, at least I began to see now, dimly, where Maltby
was, where Susan was, where we all were&mdash;except, possibly
Gertrude. Putting enormous constraint on my leaping
nerves, I subdued every trace of anger.</p>

<p>"Two more questions, Lucette. Do you believe me when
I say, with all the sincerity I'm capable of, that Susan
is slandered by these suspicions?"</p>

<p>"Really," answered Lucette, with a little worried frown,
as if anxiously balancing alternatives, "I'm not, am I, in a
position to judge?"</p>

<p>I swallowed hard. "All right," I managed to say coldly.
"Then I have placed you. You're not an onlooker&mdash;you're
an open foe."</p>

<p>"And the second question, Ambrose?"</p>

<p>"What, precisely, does Gertrude want from me?"</p>

<p>"I'm not, am I, in a position to judge?" repeated Lucette.
"But one supposes it depends a little on what
you're expecting&mdash;from her?"</p>

<p>"All I humbly plead for," said I, "is a chance to see
Gertrude alone and talk things over."</p>

<p>"Don't you mean talk <i>her</i> over?" suggested Lucette.
"And aren't you," she murmured, "forgetting the last
straw?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>My confusion of mind, my consternation, as I left the
Egyptian tomb, was pitiable. One thing, one only, I saw
with distinctness: The being I loved best was to be harried
and smirched, an innocent victim of the folly and
malignity of others.</p>

<p>"Never," I muttered, "Never&mdash;never&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>This was all very grim and virile; yet I knew that I
could grit my teeth and mutter Never! from now till the
moon blossomed, without in any way affecting the wretched
situation. Words, emotional contortions, attitudes&mdash;would
not help Susan; something sensible must be done&mdash;the
sooner the better. Something sensible and decisive&mdash;but
what? There were so many factors involved, human, incalculable
factors; my thought staggered among them,
fumbling like a drunken man for the one right door that
must be found and opened with the one right key. It was
no use; I should never be able to manage it alone. To
whom could I appeal? Susan, for the time being, was out
of the question; Maltby had maliciously betrayed a long
friendship. Phil? Why of course, there was always Phil?
Why hadn't I thought of him before?</p>

<p>I turned sharply and swung into a rapid stride. With
some difficulty I kept myself from running. Phil seemed
to me suddenly an intellectual giant, a man of infinite
heart and unclouded will. Why had I never appreciated
him at his true worth? My whirling perplexities would
have no terrors for him; he would at once see through
them to the very thing that should at once be undertaken.
Singular effect of an overwhelming desire and need! Faith
is always born of desperation. We are forced by deep-lying
instincts to trust something, someone, when we can
no longer trust ourselves. As I hurried down York Street
to his door, my sudden faith in Phil was like the faith
of a broken-spirited convert in the wisdom and mercy of
God.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Phil's quarters were on the top floor of a rooming-house
for students; he had the whole top floor to himself and
had lived there simply and contentedly many years, with
his books, his pipes, his papers, and his small open wood
fire. Phil is not destitute of taste, but he is by no means
an &aelig;sthete. His furniture is of the ordinary college-room
type&mdash;Morris chair of fumed oak, and so on&mdash;picked
up as he needed it at the nearest department store; but
he has two or three really good framed etchings on the
walls of his study; one Seymour Haden in particular&mdash;the
<i>Erith Marshes</i>&mdash;which I have often tried to persuade him
to part with. There is a blending of austerity and subtlety
in the work of the great painter-etchers that could not
but appeal to this austere yet finely organized man.</p>

<p>His books are wonderful&mdash;not for edition or binding&mdash;he
is not a bibliophile; they are wonderful because he keeps
nothing he has not found it worth while to annotate.
There is no volume on his shelves whose inside covers and
margins are not filled with criticism or suggestive comment
in his neat spiderwebby hand; and Phil's marginal notes
are usually far better reading than the original text. Susan
warmly maintains that she owes more to the inside covers
of Phil's books than to any other source; insists, in fact,
that a brief note in his copy of Santayana's <i>Reason in
Common Sense</i>, at the end of the first chapter, established
her belief once for all in mind as a true thing, an indestructible
and creative reality, destined after infinite struggle
to win its grim fight with chaos. I confess I could
never myself see in this note anything to produce so amazing
an affirmation; but in these matters I am a worm; I
have not the philosophic <i>flair</i>. Here it is:</p>

<p>"'We know that life is a dream, and how should thinking
be more?' Because, my dear Mr. Santayana, a dream
cannot propagate dreams and realize them to be such. The
answer is sufficient."</p>

<p>Well, certainly Susan, too, seemed to feel it sufficient;
and perhaps I should agree if I better understood the
answer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I have now breasted four flights to Phil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
and am knocking impatiently.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He opened to me and
welcomed me cordially, all trace of his parting gruffness
of the other evening having vanished, though he was still
haggard about the eyes. He was not alone. Through the
smoke haze of his study I saw a well-built youngster standing
near the fireplace, pipe in hand; some college boy, of
course, whom Phil was being kind to. Phil was forever
permitting these raw boys to cut in upon his precious hours
of privacy; yet he was at the opposite pole from certain
faculty members, common to all seats of learning, who
toady to the student body for a popularity which they feel
to be a good business asset, or which they find the one attainable
satisfaction for their tottering self-esteem.</p>

<p>Phil, who had had to struggle for his own education,
was genuinely fond of young men who cared enough for
education to be willing to struggle for theirs. He had become
unobtrusively, by a kind of natural affinity, the elder
brother of those undergraduates who were seekers in any
sense for the things of the mind. For the rest, the triumphant
majority&mdash;fine, manly young fellows as they
usually were, in official oratory at least&mdash;he was as blankly
indifferent as they were to him.</p>

<p>"My enthusiasm for humanity is limited, fatally limited,"
he would pleasantly admit. "For the human turnip,
even when it's a prize specimen, I have no spontaneous
affection whatever."</p>

<p>On the other hand it was not the brilliant, exceptional
boy whom he best loved. It was rather the boy whose interest
in life, whose curiosity, was just stirring toward
wakefulness after a long prenatal and postnatal sleep.
For such boys Phil poured forth treasures of sympathetic
understanding; and it was such a youth, I presume,
who stood by the fireplace now, awkwardly uncertain
whether my coming meant that he should take his leave.</p>

<p>His presence annoyed me. On more than one occasion
I had run into this sort of thing at Phil's rooms, had suffered
from the curious inability of the undergraduate,
even when he longs himself to escape, to end a visit&mdash;take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
his hat, say good-by simply, and go. It doesn't strike
one offhand as a social accomplishment of enormous difficulty;
yet it must be&mdash;it so paralyzes the social resourcefulness
of the young.</p>

<p>Phil introduced me to Mr. Kane, and Mr. Kane drooped
his right shoulder&mdash;the correct attitude for this form of
assault&mdash;grasped my hand, and shattered my nerves&mdash;with
the dislocating squeeze which young America has perfected
as the high sign of all that is virile and sincere. I sank
into a chair to recover, and to my consternation Mr. Kane,
too, sat down.</p>

<p>"Jimmy's just come to us," said Phil, relighting his
pipe. "He passed his entrance examinations in Detroit
last spring, but he had to finish up a job he was on out
there before coming East. So he has a good deal of work
to make up, first and last. And it's all the harder for
him, because he's dependent upon himself for support."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Jimmy, "what I've saved'll last me through
this year, I guess."</p>

<p>"Yes," Phil agreed; "but it's a pity to touch what
you've saved." He turned to me. "You see, Hunt, we're
talking over all the prospects. Aren't we, Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Jimmy. "Prof. Farmer thinks,"
he added, "that I may be making a mistake to try it here;
he thinks it may be a waste of time. I'm kind of up in the
air about it, myself."</p>

<p>"Jimmy's rather a special case," struck in Phil, dropping
into a Morris chair and thrusting his legs out. "He's
twenty-two now; and he's already made remarkably good
as an expert mechanic. He left his home here over six
years ago, worked his way to Detroit, applied for a job
and got it. Now there's probably no one in New Haven
who knows more than this young man about gas engines,
steel alloys, shop organization, and all that. The little
job that detained him was the working out of some minor
but important economy in the manufacture of automobiles.
He suggested it by letter to the president of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
company himself, readily obtained several interviews with
his chief, and was given a chance to try it out.</p>

<p>"It has proved its practical worth already, though you
and I are far too ignorant to understand it. As a result,
the president of the company offered him a much higher
position at an excellent salary. It's open to him still,
if he chooses to go back for it. But Jimmy has decided
to turn it down for a college education. And I'm wondering,
Hunt, whether Yale has anything to give him that
will justify such a sacrifice&mdash;anything that he couldn't
obtain for himself, at much less expense, without three
years waste of time and opportunity. How does it strike
you, old man? What would you say, offhand, without
weighing the matter?"</p>

<p>What I wanted to say was, "Damn it all! I'm not here
at this time of night to interest myself in the elementary
problems of Jimmy Kane!" In fact, I did say it to myself,
with considerable energy&mdash;only to stop at the name,
to stare at the boy before me, and to exclaim in a swift
flash of connection, "Great Scott! Are you <i>Susan's</i>
Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"'Susan's Jimmy'!" snorted Phil, with a peculiar grin.
"Of course he's Susan's Jimmy! I wondered how long it
would take you!"</p>

<p>As for Susan's Jimmy, his expression was one of desolated
amazement. Either his host and his host's friend,
or he himself&mdash;had gone suddenly mad! The drop of
his jaw was parentheses about a question mark. His blue
eyes piteously stared.</p>

<p>"I guess I'm not on, sir," he mumbled to Phil, blushing
hotly.</p>

<p>He was really a most attractive youth, considering his
origins. I eyed him now shamelessly, and was forced to
wonder that the wrong end of Birch Street should have
produced not only Susan&mdash;who would have proved the
ph&oelig;nix of any environment&mdash;but this pleasant-faced,
confidence-inspiring boy, whose expression so oddly mingled
simplicity, energy, stubborn self-respect, and the cheerfulness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of good health, an unspoiled will, and a hopeful
heart. He seemed at once too mature for his years and
too na&iuml;ve; concentration had already modelled his forehead,
but there was innocence in his eyes. Innocence&mdash;I can
only call it that. His eyes looked out at the world with
the happiest candor; and I found myself predicting of him
what I had never yet predicted of mortal woman or man:
"He's capable of anything&mdash;but sophistication; he'll get
on, he'll arrive somewhere&mdash;but he will never change."</p>

<p>Phil, meanwhile, had eased his embarrassment with a
friendly laugh. "It's all right, Jimmy; we're not the
lunatics we sound. Don't you remember Bob Blake's kid
on Birch Street?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Her?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Hunt became her guardian, you know, after&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" interrupted Jimmy, beaming on me. "You're
the gentleman that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," I responded; "I'm the unbelievably fortunate
man."</p>

<p>"She was a queer little kid," reflected Jimmy. "I
haven't thought about her for a long time."</p>

<p>"That's ungrateful of you," said Phil; "but of course
you couldn't know that."</p>

<p>Question mark and parentheses formed again.</p>

<p>"Phil means," I explained, "that Susan has never forgotten
you. It seems you did battle for her once, down
at the bottom of the Birch Street incline?"</p>

<p>"Oh, gee!" grinned Jimmy. "The time I laid out Joe
Gonfarone? Maybe I wasn't scared stiff that day! Well,
what d'y' think of her remembering that!"</p>

<p>"You'll find it's a peculiarity of Susan," said Phil,
"that she doesn't forget anything."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;she must be grown up by this time," surmised
Jimmy. "It was mighty fine of you, Mr. Hunt, to do what
you did! I'd kind of like to see her again some day. But
maybe she'd rather not," he added quickly.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Phil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said Jimmy, "she had a pretty raw deal on
Birch Street. Seeing me&mdash;might bring back things?"</p>

<p>"It couldn't," I reassured him. "Susan has never let
go of them. She uses all her experience, every part of it,
every day."</p>

<p>Jimmy grinned again. "It must keep her hustling!
But she always was different, I guess, from the rest of us."
With a vague wonder, he addressed us both: "You think
a lot of her, don't you?"</p>

<p>For some detached, ironic god this moment must have
been exquisite. I envied the god his detachment. The
blank that had followed his question puzzled Jimmy and
turned him awkward. He fidgeted with his feet.</p>

<p>"Well," he finally achieved, "I guess I'd better be off,
professor. I'll think over all you said."</p>

<p>"Do," counselled Phil, rising, "and come to see me
to-morrow. We mustn't let you take a false step if we
can avoid it."</p>

<p>"It's certainly great of you to show so much interest,"
said Jimmy, hunching himself at last out of his chair.
"I appreciate it a lot." He hesitated, then plunged.
"It's been well worth it to me to come East again&mdash;just
to meet <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" laughed Phil, shepherding him skillfully
toward the door.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>When he turned back to me, it was with the evident intention
of discussing further Jimmy's personal and educational
problems; but I rebelled.</p>

<p>"Phil," I said, "I know what Susan means to you, and
you know&mdash;I think&mdash;what she means to me. Now, through
my weakness, stupidity, or something, Susan's in danger.
Sit down please, and let me talk. I'm going to give you
all the facts, everything&mdash;a full confession. It's bound,
for many reasons, to be painful for both of us. I'm sorry,
old man&mdash;but we'll have to rise to it for Susan's sake;
see this thing through together. I feel utterly imbecile and
helpless alone."</p>

<p>Half an hour later I had ended my monologue, and we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
both sat silent, staring at the dulled embers on the
hearth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>At length Phil drew in a slow, involuntary breath.</p>

<p>"Hunt," he said, "it's a humiliating thing for a professional
philosopher to admit, but I simply can't trust
myself to advise you. I don't know what you ought to
do; I don't know what Susan ought to do; or what I should
do. I don't even know what your wife should do; though
I feel fairly certain that whatever it is, she will try something
else. Frankly, I'm too much a part of it all, too
heartsick, for honest thought."</p>

<p>He smiled drearily and added, as if at random: "'Physician,
heal thyself.' What an abysmal joke! How the
fiends of hell must treasure it. They have only one better&mdash;'Man
is a reasonable being!'" He rose, or rather he
seemed to be propelled from his chair. "Hunt! Would
you really like to know what all my days and nights of
intense study have come to? The kind of man you've
turned to for strength? My life has come to just this:
I love her, and she doesn't love me!</p>

<p>"Oh!" he cried&mdash;"Go home. For God's sake, go home!
I'm ashamed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>So I departed, like Omar, through the same door wherein
I went; but not before I had grasped&mdash;as it seemed to me
for the first time&mdash;Phil's hand.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>There are some verses in Susan's notebook of this period,
themselves undated, and never subsequently published,
which&mdash;from their position on the page&mdash;must have been
written about this time and may have been during the
course of the momentous evening on which I met Jimmy
Kane at Phil Farmer's rooms. I give them now, not as a
favorable specimen of her work, since she thought best
to exclude them from her first volume, but because they
throw some light at least on the complicated and rather
obscure state of mind that was then hers. They have no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
title, and need none. If you should feel they need interpretation&mdash;"<i>guarda
e passa</i>"! They are not for you.</p>

<div class='poem'>
<i>Though she rose from the sea</i><br />
<i>There were stains upon her whiteness;</i><br />
<i>All earth's waters had not sleeked her clean.</i><br />
<i>For no tides gave her birth,</i><br />
<i>Nor the salt, glimmering middle depths;</i><br />
<i>But slime spawned her, the couch of life,</i><br />
<i>The sunless ooze,</i><br />
<i>The green bed of Poseidon,</i><br />
<i>Where with sordid Chaos he mingles obscurely.</i><br />
<i>Her flanks were of veined marble;</i><br />
<i>There were stains upon her.</i><br />
<br />
<i>But she who passes, lonely,</i><br />
<i>Through waste places,</i><br />
<i>Through bog and forest;</i><br />
<i>Who follows boar and stag</i><br />
<i>Unwearied;</i><br />
<i>Who sleeps, fearless, among the hills;</i><br />
<i>Though she track the wilds,</i><br />
<i>Though she breast the crags,</i><br />
<i>Choosing no path&mdash;</i><br />
<i>Her kirtle tears not,</i><br />
<i>Her ankles gleam,</i><br />
<i>Her sandals are silver.</i><br />
</div>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>It was midnight when I reached my own door that night,
but I was in no mood for lying in bed stark awake in the
spiritual isolation of darkness. I went straight to my
study, meaning to make up a fire and then hypnotize myself
into some form of lethargy by letting my eyes follow
the printed lines of a book. If reading in any other sense
than physical habit proved beyond me, at least the narcotic
monotony of habit might serve.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>But I found a fire, already falling to embers, and Susan
before it, curled into my big wing chair, her feet beneath
her, her hands lying palms upward in her lap. This picture
fixed me in the doorway while my throat tightened. Susan
did not stir, but she was not sleeping. She had withdrawn.</p>

<p>Presently she spoke, absently&mdash;from Saturn's rings; or
the moon.</p>

<p>"Ambo? I've been waiting to talk to you; but now I
can't or I'll lose it&mdash;the whole movement. It's like a symphony&mdash;great
brasses groaning and cursing&mdash;and then
violins tearing through the tumult to soar above it."</p>

<p>Her eyes shut for a moment. When she opened them
again it was to shake herself free from whatever spell had
bound her. She half yawned, and smiled.</p>

<p>"Gone, dear&mdash;all gone. It's not your fault. Words
wouldn't hold it. Music might&mdash;but music doesn't come.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Oh, poor Ambo&mdash;you've had a wretched time of it!
How tired you look!"</p>

<p>I shut the door quietly and went to her, sitting on the
hearth rug at her feet, my knees in my arms.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart," I said, "it seems that in spite of myself
I've done you little good and about all the harm possible."
And I made a clean breast of all the facts and fears that
the evening had developed. "So you see," I ended, "what
my guardianship amounts to!"</p>

<p>Susan's hand came to my shoulder and drew me back
against her knees; she did not remove her hand.</p>

<p>"Ambo," she protested gently, "I'm just a little angry
with you, I think."</p>

<p>"No wonder!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed. "If I am angry it's because you
can say stupid things like that! Don't you see, Ambo, the
very moment things grow difficult for us you forget to
believe in me&mdash;begin to act as if I were a common or
garden fool? I'm not, though. Surely you must know in
your heart that everything you're afraid of for me doesn't
matter in the least. What harm could slander or scandal
possibly do me, dear? Me, I mean? I shouldn't like it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of course, because I hate everything stodgy and <i>formidablement
b&ecirc;te</i>. But if it happens, I shan't lose much sleep over
it. You're worrying about the wrong things, Ambo;
things that don't even touch our real problem. And the
real problem may prove to be the real tragedy, too."</p>

<p>"Tragedy?" I mumbled.</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope not&mdash;I think not! It all depends on whether
you care for freedom; on whether you're really passion's
slave. I don't believe you are."</p>

<p>The words wounded me. I shifted, to look up at, to
question, her shadowy face. "Susan, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I mean that <i>I'm</i> not, Ambo. You're far
dearer to me than anybody else on earth; your happiness,
your peace, mean everything to me. If you honestly can't
find life worth while without me&mdash;can't&mdash;I'll go with you
anywhere; or face the music with you right here. First,
though, I must be sincere with you. I can live away from
you, and still make a life for myself. Except your day-by-day
companionship&mdash;I'd be lonely without that, of
course&mdash;I shouldn't lose anything that seems to me really
worth keeping. Above all, I shouldn't really lose you."</p>

<p>"Susan! You're planning to leave me!"</p>

<p>"But, Ambo&mdash;it's only what you've felt to be necessary;
what you've been planning for me!"</p>

<p>"As a duty&mdash;at the bitterest possible cost! How different
that is! You not only plan to leave me&mdash;I feel that
you want to!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I want to. But only if you can understand why."</p>

<p>"I don't understand!"</p>

<p>"Ah, wait, Ambo! You're not speaking for yourself.
You're a slave now, speaking for your master. But it's
<i>you</i> I want to talk to!"</p>

<p>I snarled at this. "Why? When you've discovered your
mistake so soon!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You don't love me."</p>

<p>She sighed, deeply unhappy; though my thin-skinned
self-esteem wrung from her sigh a shade of impatience,
too.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"If not, dear," she said, "we had better find it out before
it's too late. Perhaps you are right. Perhaps love is
something I only guess at and go wrong about. If love
means that I should be utterly lost in you and nothing without
you&mdash;if it means that I would rather die than leave
you&mdash;well, then I don't love you. But all the same, if
love honestly means that to you&mdash;I can't and won't go
away." She put out her hand again swiftly, and tightened
her fingers on mine.</p>

<p>"It's a test, then. Is that it?" I demanded. "You want
to go because you're not sure?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure of what I feel," she broke in; "and more than
that, I doubt if I'm made so that I can ever feel more.
No; that isn't why I want to go. I'll go if you can let
me, because&mdash;oh, I've got to say it, Ambo!&mdash;because at
heart I love freedom better than I love love&mdash;or you. And
there's something else. I'm afraid of&mdash;please try to understand
this, dear&mdash;I'm afraid of stuffiness for us both!"</p>

<p>"Stuffiness?"</p>

<p>"Sex <i>is</i> stuffy, Ambo. The more people let it mess up
their lives for them, the stuffier they grow. It's really
what you've been afraid of for me&mdash;though you don't put
it that way. But you hate the thought of people saying&mdash;with
all the muddy little undercurrents they stir up round
such things&mdash;that you and I have been passion's slaves.
We haven't been&mdash;but we might be; and suppose we were.
It's the truth about us&mdash;not the lies&mdash;that makes all the
difference. You're you&mdash;and I'm I. It's because we're
worth while to ourselves that we're worth while to each
other. Isn't that true? But how long shall we be worth
anything to ourselves or to each other if we accept love as
slavery, and get to feeling that we can't face life, if it
seems best, alone? Ambo, dear, do you see at all what I'm
driving at?"</p>

<p>Yes; I was beginning to see. Miss Goucher's desolate
words came suddenly back to me: "Susan doesn't need
<i>you</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>Next morning, while I supposed her at work in her
room, Susan slipped down the back stairs and off through
the garden. It was a heavy forenoon for me, perhaps
the bleakest and dreariest of my life. But it was a
busy forenoon for Susan. She began its activities by a
brave intuitive stroke. She entered the Egyptian tomb
and demanded an interview with Gertrude. What is
stranger, she carried her point&mdash;as I was presently to be
made aware.</p>

<p>Miss Goucher tapped at the door, entered, and handed
me a card. So Gertrude had changed her mind; Gertrude
had come. I stared, foolishly blank, at the card between,
my fingers, while Miss Goucher by perfect stillness effaced
herself, leaving me to my lack of thought.</p>

<p>"Well," I finally muttered, "sooner or later&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Goucher, perhaps too eagerly, took this for assent.
"Shall I say to Mrs. Hunt that you are coming down?"</p>

<p>I forced a smile, fatuously enough, and rose.</p>

<p>"When I'm down already? Surely you can see, Miss
Goucher, that I've touched the bottom?" Miss Goucher
did not reply. "I'll go myself at once," I added formally.
"Thank you, Miss Goucher."</p>

<p>Gertrude was waiting in the small Georgian reception
room, whose detailed correctness had been due to her own;
waiting without any vulgar pretense at entire composure.
She was walking slowly about, her color was high, and it
startled me to find her so little altered. Not a day seemed
to have added itself; she looked under thirty, though I
knew her to be thirty-five; she was even handsomer than
I had chosen to remember. Even in her present unusual
restlessness, the old distinction, the old patrician authority
was hers. Her spirit imposed itself, as always; one could
take Gertrude only as she wished to be taken&mdash;seriously&mdash;humbly
grateful if exempted from disdain. Gertrude
never spoke for herself alone; she was at all times representative&mdash;almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
symbolic. Homage met in her not a
personal gratitude, but the approval of a high, unbroken
tradition. She accepted it graciously, without obvious
egotism, not as due to her as a temporal being, but as due&mdash;under
God&mdash;to that timeless entity, her class. I am not
satirizing Gertrude; I am praising her. She, more than
any person I have ever known, made of her perishing substance
the temple of a completely realized ideal.</p>

<p>It was, I am forced to assume, because I had failed in
entire respect for and submission to this ideal that she had
finally abandoned me. It was not so much incompatibility
of temperament as incompatibility of worship. She had
removed a hallowed shrine from a felt indifference and
a possible contamination. That was all, but it was everything.
And as I walked into the reception room I saw that
the shrine was still beautiful, faultlessly tended, and ready
for any absolute but dignified sacrifice.</p>

<p>"Gertrude," I began, "it's splendid of you to overlook
my inexcusable rudeness of yesterday! I'm very grateful."</p>

<p>"I have not forgiven you," she replied, with casual
indignation&mdash;just enough for sincerity and not a shade
too much for art. "Don't imagine it's pleasant for me to
be here. I should hardly have risked your misinterpreting
it, if any other course had seemed possible."</p>

<p>"You might simply have waited," I said. "It was my
intention to call this evening, if only to ask after your
health."</p>

<p>"I could not have received you," said Gertrude.</p>

<p>"You find it less difficult here?"</p>

<p>"Less humiliating. I'm not, at least, receiving a husband
who wishes to plead for reconciliation&mdash;on intolerable
grounds."</p>

<p>"May I offer you a chair? Better still&mdash;why not come
to the study? We're so much less likely to be disturbed."</p>

<p>She accepted my suggestion with a slight nod, and herself
led the way.</p>

<p>"Now, Gertrude," I resumed, when she had consented
to an easy-chair and had permitted me to close the door,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
"whatever the situation and misunderstandings between
us, can't we discuss them"&mdash;and I ventured a smile&mdash;"more
informally, in a freer spirit?"</p>

<p>She caught me up. "Freer! But I understand&mdash;less
disciplined. How very like you, Ambrose. How unchanged
you are."</p>

<p>"And you, Gertrude! It's a compliment you should
easily forgive."</p>

<p>She preferred to ignore it. "Miss Blake," she announced,
"has just been with me for an hour."</p>

<p>She waited the effect of this. The effect was considerable,
plunging me into dark amazement and conjecture.
Not daring to make the tiniest guess as to the result of so
fantastic an interview, I was left not merely tongue-tied
but brain-tied. Gertrude saw at once that she had beggared
me and could now at her leisure dole out the equal
humiliation of alms withheld or bestowed.</p>

<p>"Given your curious social astigmatism and her curious
mixed charm&mdash;so subtle and so deeply uncivilized&mdash;I can
see, of course, why she has bewitched you," said Gertrude
reflectively, and paused. "And I can see," she continued,
musing, as if she had adopted the stage convention of
soliloquy, "why you have just failed to capture her imagination.
For you have failed&mdash;but you can hardly be
aware how completely."</p>

<p>"Whether or not I'm aware," I snapped, "seems negligible!
Susan feels she must leave me, and she'll probably
act with her usual promptness. Is that what she called
to tell you?"</p>

<p>"Partly," acknowledged Gertrude, resuming then her
soliloquy: "You've given her&mdash;as you would&mdash;a ridiculous
education. She seems to have instincts, impulses, which&mdash;all
things considered&mdash;might have bloomed if cultivated.
As it is, you found her crude, and, in spite of all the culture
you've crammed upon her, you've left her so. She's
emancipated&mdash;that is, public; she's thrown away the locks
and keys of her mind. I grant she has one. But apparently
no one has even suggested to her that the essence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of being rare, of being fine, is knowing what to omit, what
to reject, what to conceal. I find my own people, Ambrose&mdash;and
they're the <i>right</i> people, the only ones worth finding&mdash;by
feeling secure with them; I can trust them not to go
too far. They have decorum, taste. Oh, I admit we're
upholding a lost cause! You're a deserter from it&mdash;and
Miss Blake doesn't even suspect its existence. Still"&mdash;with
a private smile&mdash;"her crudity had certain immediate
advantages this morning."</p>

<p>Ignoring rarity, fineness, I sank to the indecorum of a
frankly human grin. "In other words, Gertrude, Susan
omitted so little, went so much too far, that she actually
forced you for once to get down to brass tacks!"</p>

<p>Gertrude frowned. "She stripped herself naked before
a stranger&mdash;if that's what you mean."</p>

<p>"With the result, Gertrude?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that's why I'm here&mdash;as a duty I owe myself. I'm
bound to say my suspicions were unjust&mdash;to Miss Blake,
at least. I'll even go beyond that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Careful, Gertrude! Evil communications corrupt good
manners."</p>

<p>"Yes," she responded quickly, rising, "they do&mdash;always;
that's why I'm not here to stay. But all I have left for
you, Ambrose, is this: I'm convinced now that in one
respect I've been quite wrong. Miss Blake convinced me
this morning that her astounding telegram had at least one
merit. It happened to be true. I <i>should</i> either live with
you or set you free. I've felt this myself, from time to
time, but divorce, for many reasons.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." She paused,
then added: "However, it seems inevitable. If you wish
to divorce me, you have legal grounds&mdash;desertion; I even
advise it, and I shall make no defense. As for your amazing
ward&mdash;make your mind quite easy about her. If any
rumors should annoy you, they'll not come from me. And
I shall speak to Lucette." She moved to the door, opening
it slowly. "That's all, I think, Ambrose?"</p>

<p>"It's not even a beginning," I cried.</p>

<p>"Think of it, rather, as an ending."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Impossible! I&mdash;I'm abashed, Gertrude! What you
propose is out of the question. Why not think better of
returning here? The heydey's past for both of us. My
dream&mdash;always a wild dream&mdash;is passing; and I can promise
sincere understanding and respect."</p>

<p>"I could not promise so easily," said Gertrude; "nor so
much. No; don't come with me," she added. "I know my
way perfectly well alone."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I went with her to the front door, as I
ought, in no perfunctory spirit. It was more than a courteous
habit; it was a genuine tribute of admiration. I
admired her beauty, her impeccable bearing, her frock, her
furs, her intellect, the ease and distinction of her triumph.
She left me crushed; yet it was a privilege to have known
her&mdash;to have wooed her, won her, lost her; and now to
have received my <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i> from her competent, disdainful
hands. I wished her well, knowing the wish superfluous.
In this, if nothing else, she resembled Susan&mdash;she
did not need me; she could stand alone. It was her
tragedy, in the French classic manner, that she must.
Would it also in another manner, in a deeper and&mdash;I can
think of no homelier word&mdash;more cosmic sense, prove to be
Susan's?</p>

<p>But my own stuffy problem drama, whether tragic or
absurd, had now reached a crisis and developed its final
question: How in the absence of Susan to stand at all?</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>From her interview with Gertrude, Susan went straight
on to Phil's rooms, not even stopping to consider the possible
proprieties involved. But, five minutes before her
arrival, Phil had been summoned to the Graduates Club
to receive a long-distance call from his Boston publisher;
and it was Jimmy Kane who answered her knock and
opened the study door. He had been in conference with
Phil on his private problems and Phil had asked him to
await his return. All this he thought it courteous to explain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to the peach of a girl before him, whose presence at
the door puzzled him mightily, and whose disturbing eyes
held his, he thought, rather too intimately and quizzically
for a stranger's.</p>

<p>She could hardly be some graduate student in philosophy;
she was too young and too flossy for that. "Flossy,"
in Jimmy's economical vocabulary, was a symbol for many
subtle shades of meaning: it implied, for any maiden it
fitted, an elegance not too cold to be alluring; the possession
of that something more than the peace of God which a
friend told Emerson always entered her heart when she
knew herself to be well dressed. Flossy&mdash;to generalize&mdash;Jimmy
had not observed the women graduate students
to be, though he bore them no ill will. To be truly flossy
was, after all, a privilege reserved for a chosen few, born
to a certain circle which Jimmy had never sought to penetrate.</p>

<p>One&mdash;and a curiously entrancing specimen&mdash;of the
chosen evidently stood watching him now, and he wished
that her entire self-possession did not so utterly imperil
his own. What was she doing alone, anyway, this society
girl&mdash;in a students' rooming house&mdash;at Prof. Farmer's
door? Why couldn't she tell him? And why were her
eyes making fun of him&mdash;or weren't they? His fingers
went instinctively to his&mdash;perhaps too hastily selected?&mdash;cravat.</p>

<p>Then Susan really did laugh, but happily, not unkindly,
and walked on in past him, shutting the door behind her
as she came.</p>

<p>"Jimmy Kane," she said, "if I weren't so gorgeously
glad to see you again, I could beat you for not remembering!"</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" he babbled. "Why&mdash;good Lord! You're
Susan!"</p>

<p>It was all too much for him; concealment was impossible&mdash;he
was flabbergasted. Sparkling with sheer delight
at his <i>gaucherie</i>, Susan put out both hands. Her impulsiveness
instantly revived him; he seized her hands for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
moment as he might have gripped a long-lost boy friend's.</p>

<p>"You never guessed I could look so&mdash;presentable, did
you?" demanded Susan.</p>

<p>"Presentable!" The word jarred on him, it was so dully
inadequate.</p>

<p>"I have a maid," continued Susan demurely. "Everything
in Ambo's house&mdash;Ambo is my guardian, you know;
Mr. Hunt&mdash;well, everything in his house is a work of art.
So he pays a maid to see that I am&mdash;always. I am simply
clay in her hands, and it does make a difference. But I
didn't have a maid on Birch Street, Jimmy."</p>

<p>Jimmy's blue eyes capered. This was American humor&mdash;the
kind he was born to and could understand. Happiness
and ease returned with it. If Susan could talk like that
while looking like that&mdash;well, Susan was <i>there!</i> She was
all right.</p>

<p>Within five minutes he was giving her a brief, comradely
chronicle of the missing years, and when Phil got back it
was to find them seated together, Susan leaning a little
forward from the depths of a Morris chair to follow more
attentively Jimmy's minute technical description of the
nature of the steel alloys used in the manufacture of automobiles.</p>

<p>They rose at Phil's entrance with a mingling, eager
chatter of explanation. Phil later&mdash;much later&mdash;admitted
to me that he had never felt till that moment how damnably
he was past forty, and how fatally Susan was not. He
further admitted that it was far from the most agreeable
discovery of a studious life.</p>

<p>"What do you think, Prof. Farmer," exclaimed Jimmy,
"of our meeting again accidentally like this&mdash;and me not
knowing Susan! You can't beat that much for a small
world!"</p>

<p>Phil sought Susan's eye, and was somewhat relieved by
the quizzical though delighted gleam in it.</p>

<p>"Well, Jimmy," he responded gravely, "truth compels
me to state that I have heard of stranger encounters&mdash;less
inevitable ones, at least. I really have."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you never heard of a nicer one," said Susan.
"Haven't I always told you and Ambo that Jimmy would
be like this?"</p>

<p>"Sort of foolish?" grinned Jimmy, with reawakening
constraint. "I'll bet you have, too."</p>

<p>Susan shook her head, solemn and slow; but the corners
of her mouth meant mischief.</p>

<p>"No, Jimmy, not foolish; just&mdash;natural. Just&mdash;sort
of&mdash;<i>you</i>."</p>

<p>At this point, Jimmy hastily remembered that he must
beat it, pleading what Phil knew to be an imaginary recitation.
But he did not escape without finding himself invited
to dinner for that very evening, informally of course&mdash;Susan
suspected the absence of even a dinner coat: Phil
would bring him. It was really Phil who accepted for
him, while Jimmy was still muddling through his thanks
and toiling on to needless apologies.</p>

<p>"If I've been too"&mdash;he almost said "fresh," but sank
to&mdash;"familiar, calling you by your first name, I mean&mdash;I
wouldn't like you to think&mdash;but coming all of a sudden
like this, what I mean is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, run along!" called Susan gayly. "Forget it,
Jimmy! You're spoiling everything."</p>

<p>"That's what I m-mean," stammered Jimmy, and was
gone.</p>

<p>"But he does mean well, Susan," Phil pleaded for him,
after closing the door.</p>

<p>It puzzled him to note that Susan's face instantly
clouded; there was reproof in her tone. "That was patronizing,
Phil. I won't have anybody patronize Jimmy. He's
perfect."</p>

<p>Phil was oddly nettled by this reproof and grew stubborn
and detached. "He's a nice boy, certainly; and has
the makings of a real man. I believe in him. Still&mdash;heaven
knows!&mdash;he's not precisely a subtle soul."</p>

<p>Susan's brow had cleared again. "That's what I
m-mean!" she laughed, mimicking Jimmy without satire,
as if for the pure pleasure of recollection. "The truth is,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Phil, I'm rather fed up on subtlety&mdash;especially my own.
Sometimes I think it's just a polite term for futility, with
a dash of intellectual snobbishness thrown in. It must be
saner, cleaner, healthier, to take life straight."</p>

<p>"And now, Phil dear," she said, dismissing the matter,
as if settling back solidly to earth after a pleasantly breathless
a&euml;rial spin, "I need your advice. Can I earn my
living as a writer? I'll write anything that pays, so I think
I can. Fashion notes&mdash;anything! Sister and I"&mdash;"Sister"
being Susan's pet name for Miss Goucher&mdash;"are running
away to New York on Monday&mdash;to make our fortunes.
You mustn't tell Ambo&mdash;yet; I'll tell him in my own way.
And I must <i>make</i> my own way now, Phil. I've been a lazy
parasite long enough&mdash;too long! So please sit down and
write me subtle letters of introduction to any publishers
you know. Maltby is bound to help me, of course. You
see, I'm feeling ruthless&mdash;or shameless; I shall pull every
wire in sight. So I'm counting on <i>The Garden Exquisite</i>
for immediate bread and butter. I did my first article for
it in an hour when I first woke up this morning&mdash;just the
smarty-party piffle its readers and advertisers seem to demand.</p>

<p>"This sort of thing, Phil: 'The poets are wrong, as
usual. Wild flowers are not shy and humble, they are
exclusive. How to know them is still a social problem in
American life, and very few of us have attained this aristocratic
distinction.' And so on! Two thousand silly salable
words&mdash;and I can turn on that soda-water tap at will.
Are you listening? Please tell me you don't think poor
Sister&mdash;she refuses to leave me, and I wouldn't let her anyway&mdash;will
have to undergo martyrdom in a cheap hall
bedroom for the rest of her days?"</p>

<p>Needless to say, Phil did not approve of Susan's plan.
He agreed with her that under the given conditions she
could not remain with me in New Haven; and he commended
her courage, her desire for independence. But
Susan would never, he felt, find her true pathway to independence,
either material or spiritual, as a journalistic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
free-lance in New York. He admitted the insatiable public
thirst for soda-water, but saw no reason why Susan
should waste herself in catering to it. He was by no means
certain that she could cater to it if she would.</p>

<p>"You'll too often discover," he warned her, "that your
tap is running an unmarketable beverage. The mortal
taste for nectar is still undeveloped; it remains the drink
of the gods."</p>

<p>"But," Susan objected, "I can't let Ambo pay my bills
from now on&mdash;I can't! And Sister and I must live decently
somehow! I'd like nothing better than to be a
perpetual fountain of nectar&mdash;supposing, you nice old
Phil, that I've ever really had the secret of distilling a
single drop of it. But you say yourself there's no market
for it this side of heaven, which is where we all happen to
be. What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"Marry me."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be fair to you, dear."</p>

<p>There was a momentary pause.</p>

<p>"Then," said Phil earnestly, "I want you to let Hunt&mdash;or
if you can't bring yourself to do that&mdash;to let <i>me</i> loan
you money enough from time to time to live on simply and
comfortably for a few years, while you study and think
and write in your own free way&mdash;till you've found yourself.
My nectar simile was nonsense, just as your soda-water
tap was. You have brains and a soul, and the
combination means a shining career of some kind&mdash;even on
earth. Don't fritter your genius away in makeshift activities.
Mankind needs the best we have in us; the best's
none too good. It's a duty&mdash;no, it's more than that&mdash;it's a
true <i>religion</i> to get that expressed somehow&mdash;whether in
terms of action or thought or beauty. I know, of course,
you feel this as I do, and mean to win through to it in the
end. But why handicap yourself so cruelly at the start?"</p>

<p>Phil tells me that Susan, while he urged this upon her,
quietly withdrew and did not return for some little time
after he had ceased to speak. He was not even certain she
had fully heard him out until she suddenly leaned to him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
from her chair and gave his hand an affectionate, grateful
squeeze.</p>

<p>"Yes, Phil," she said, "it is a religion&mdash;it's perhaps
the only religion I shall ever have. But for that very reason
I must accept it in my own way. And I'm sure&mdash;it's
part of my faith&mdash;that any coddling now will do me more
harm <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'that'">than</ins> good. I must meet the struggle, Phil&mdash;the hand-to-hand
fight. If the ordinary bread-and-butter conditions
are too much for me, then I'm no good and must go under.
I shan't be frittering anything away if I fail. I shan't
fail&mdash;in our sense&mdash;unless we're both mistaken, and there
isn't anything real in me. That's what I must find out
first&mdash;not sheltered and in silence, but down in the scrimmage
and noise of it all. If I'm too delicate for that, then
I've nothing to give this world, and the sooner I'm crushed
out of it the better! Believe me, Phil dear, I know I'm
right; I <i>know</i>."</p>

<p>She was pressing clenched hands almost fiercely between
her girl's breasts as she ended, as if to deny or repress any
natural longing for a special protection, a special graciousness
and security, from our common taskmaster, life.</p>

<p>Phil admits that he wanted to whimper like a homesick
boy.</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>Susan's informal dinner for Jimmy that evening was
not really a success. The surface of the water sparkled
from time to time, but there were grim undercurrents and
icy depths. Perhaps it was not so bad as my own impression
of it, for I had a sullen headache pulsing its tiresome
obbligato above a dull ground base of despair. Despair, I
am forced to call it. Never had life seemed to me so little
worth the trouble of going on; and I fancy Phil's reasoned
conviction of its eternal dignity and import had become,
for the present, less of a comfort to him than a curse.
Moods of this kind, however ruthlessly kept under, infect
the very air about them. They exude a drab fog to deaden
spontaneity and choke laughter at its source.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Neither Phil nor I was guilty of deliberate sulking;
whether from false pride or native virtue we did our best&mdash;but
our best was abysmal. Even Susan sank under it to
the flat levels of made conversation, and poor Jimmy&mdash;who
had brought with him many social misgivings&mdash;was
stricken at table with a muscular rigor; sat stiffly, handled
his implements jerkily, and ended by oversetting a glass
of claret and blushing till the dusky red of his face
matched the spreading stain before him.</p>

<p>At this crisis of gloom, luckily, Susan struggled clear
of the drab fog and saved the remnant of the evening&mdash;at
least for Jimmy, plunging with the happiest effect into
the junior annals of Birch Street, till our heavier Hillhouse
atmosphere stirred and lightened with <i>Don't-you-remember's</i>
and <i>Sure-I-do's</i>. And shortly after dinner, Phil,
tactfully pleading an unprepared lecture, dragged Jimmy
off with him before this bright flare-up of youthful reminiscence
had even threatened to expire. Their going
brought Susan at once to my side, with a stricken face of
self-reproach.</p>

<p>"It was so stupid of me, Ambo&mdash;this dinner. I've never
been more ashamed. How could I have forced it on you
to-night! But you were wonderful, dear&mdash;wonderful! So
was Phil. I'll never forget it." There were tears in her
eyes. "Oh, Ambo," she wailed, "do you think I shall
ever learn to be a little like either of you? I feel&mdash;abject."
Before I could prevent it, she had seized my hand in both
hers and kissed it. "Homage," she smiled.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>It broke me down&mdash;utterly.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You will spare me any
description of the next ten minutes of childishness. Indeed,
you must spare me the details of our later understanding;
they are inviolable. It is enough to say that I
emerged from it&mdash;for the experience had been overwhelming&mdash;with
a new spirit, a clarified and serener mind. My
love for Susan was unchanged&mdash;yet wholly changed. The
paradox is exact. Life once more seemed to me good, since
she was part of it; and my own life rich, since I now knew
how truly it had become a portion of hers. She had made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
me feel, know, that I counted for her&mdash;unworthy as I am&mdash;in
all she had grown to be and would grow to be. We had
shaped and would always shape each other's lives. There
for the moment it rested. She would leave me, but I was
not to be alone.</p>

<p>No; I was not to be alone. For even if she had died,
or had quite changed and forsaken me, there would be
memories&mdash;such as few men have been privileged to
recall.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>


<h3>INTERLUDE</h3>

<p>On the rearward and gentler slopes of Mount Carmel,
a rough, isolated little mountain, very abrupt on its southerly
face, which rises six or seven miles up-country from
the New Haven Green, there is an ancient farm, so long
abandoned as to be completely overgrown with gray birch&mdash;the
old field birch of exhausted soils&mdash;with dogwood and
an aromatic tangle of humbler shrubs, high-bush huckleberry
and laurel and sweet fern; while beneath these the
dry elastic earth-floor is a deep couch of ghost-gray moss,
shining checkerberry and graceful ground pine. The
tumbledown farmstead itself lies either unseen at some
distance from these abandoned fields or has wholly disappeared
along with the neat stone fences that must once
have marked them. Yet the boundaries of the fields are
now majestically defined through the undergrowth by rows
of gigantic red cedars so thickset, so tall, shapely, and
dense as to resemble the secular cypresses of Italian
gardens more nearly than the poor relations they ordinarily
are.</p>

<p>And at the upper edge of one steep-lying field, formerly
an apple orchard&mdash;though but three or four of the original
apple trees remain, hopelessly decrepit and half buried in
the new growth&mdash;the older cedars of the fence line have
seeded capriciously and have thrown out an almost perfect
circle of younger, slenderer trees which, standing shoulder
to shoulder, inclose the happiest retreat for woodland god<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
or dreaming mortal that the most exacting faun or poet
could desire.</p>

<p>That Susan should have happened upon this lonely, this
magic circle, I can never regard as a mere accident.
Obviously time had slowly and lovingly formed and perfected
it for some purpose; it was there waiting for her&mdash;and
one day she came and possessed it, and the magic circle
was complete.</p>

<p>Susan was then seventeen and the season, as it should
have been, was early May. Much of the hill country lying
northward from the Connecticut coast towns is surprisingly
wild, and none of it wilder or lovelier than certain
tracts spread within easy reach of the few New Haveners
who have not wholly capitulated to business or college
politics or golf or social service or the movies, forgetting
a deeper and saner lure. A later Wordsworth or
Thoreau might still live in midmost New Haven and never
feel shut from his heritage, for it neighbors him closely&mdash;swamp
and upland, hemlock cliff and hardwood forest,
precipitous brook or slow-winding meadow stream, where
the red-winged blackbirds flute and flash by; the whole
year's wonder awaits him; he has but to go forth&mdash;alone.</p>

<p>Nature never did betray the heart that loved her, though
she so ironically betrays most of us who merely pretend
to love her, because we feel, after due instruction, that we
ought. For Nature is not easily communicative, nor
lightly wooed. She demands a higher devotion than an
occasional picnic, and will seldom have much to say to you
if she feels that you secretly prefer another society to hers.
To her elect she whispers, timelessly, and Susan, in her
own way, was of the elect. It was the way&mdash;the surest&mdash;of
solitary communion; but it was very little, very casually,
the way of science. She observed much, but without
method; and catalogued not at all. She never counted her
warblers and seldom named them&mdash;but she loved them, as
they slipped northward through young leaves, shyly, with
pure flashes of green or russet or gold.</p>

<p>Nature for Susan, in short, was all mood, ranging from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
cold horror to supernal beauty; she did not sentimentalize
the gradations. The cold horror was there and chilled her,
but the supernal beauty was there too&mdash;and did not leave
her cold. And through it all streamed an indefinable awe,
a trail one could not follow, a teasing mystery&mdash;an
unspoken word. It was back of&mdash;no rather it interpenetrated
the horror no less than the beauty; they were but
phases, hints, of that other, that suspected, eerie trail,
leading one knew not where.</p>

<p>But surely there, in that magic circle, one might press
closer, draw oneself nearer, catch at the faintest hint
toward a possible clue? The aromatic space within the
cedars became Susan's refuge, her nook from the world,
her Port-Royal, her Walden, her Lake Isle of Innisfree.
Once found that spring she never spoke of it; she hoarded
her treasure, slipping off to it stealthily, through slyest
subterfuge or evasion, whenever she could. For was it not
hers?</p>

<p>Sometimes she rode out there, tying her horse to a tree
in the lowest field back of a great thicket of old-fashioned
lilac bushes run wild, where he was completely hidden from
the rare passers-by of the rough up-country road or lane.
But oftenest, she has since confessed, she would clear her
morning or afternoon by some plausible excuse for absence,
then board the Waterbury trolley express, descending from
it about two miles from her nook, and walking or rather
climbing up to it crosslots through neglected woodland and
uncropped pasture reverting to the savage.</p>

<p>At one point she had to pass a small swampy meadow
through which a mere thread of stream worked its way,
half-choked by thick-springing blades of our native wild
iris; so infinitely, so capriciously delicate in form and hue.
And here, if these were in bloom, she always lingered a
while, poised on the harsh hummocks of bent-grass, herself
slender as a reed. The pale, softly pencilled iris petals
stirred in her a high wonder beyond speech. What
supreme, whimsical artistry brought them to being there,
in that lonely spot; and for whose joy? No human hand,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
cunning with enamel and platinum and treated silver,
could, after a lifetime of patience, reproduce one petal of
these uncounted flowers. Out of the muck they lifted,
ethereal, unearthly&mdash;yet so soon to die.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Oh, she knew what the learned had to say of them!&mdash;that
they were merely sexual devices; painted deceptions
for attracting insects and so assuring cross-pollination and
the lusty continuance of their race. So far as it went this
was unquestionably true; but it went&mdash;just how far?
Their color and secret manna attracted the necessary insects,
which they fed; the form of their petals and perianth
tubes, and the arrangement of their organs of sex were
cunningly evolved, so that the insect that sought their
nectar bore from one flower to the next its fertilizing
golden dust&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Astonishing, certainly! But what astonished her far
more was that all this ingenious mechanism should in any
way affect <i>her!</i> It was obviously none of her affair; and
yet to come upon these cunning mechanistic devices in this
deserted field stirred her, set something ineffable free in
her&mdash;gave it joy for wings. It was as if these pale blooms
of wild iris had been for her, in a less mortal sense, what
the unconscious insects were for them&mdash;<i>intermediaries</i>,
whose more ethereal contacts cross-fertilized her very soul.
But she could not define for herself or express for others
what they did to her. Of one thing only she was certain:
These fleeting moments of expansion, of illumination, were
brief and vague&mdash;moments of pure, uncritical feeling&mdash;but
they were the best moments of her life; and they were real.
They vanished, but not wholly. They left lasting traces.
Never to have been visited by them would have condemned
her, she knew, to be less than her fullest self, narrower in
sympathy, more rigid, more dogmatic, and less complete.</p>

<p>But that first May day of her discovery, when called out
to wander lonely as a cloud by the spirit of spring&mdash;the
day she had happened on her magic circle,&mdash;all that rough
upland world was burgeoning, and the beauty of those
deserted fields hurt the heart. Susan never easily wept,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
but that day&mdash;safely hidden in the magic circle, then newly
hers&mdash;she threw herself down on the ghost-gray moss
among the spicy tufts of sweet fern and enjoyed, as she
later told me, the most sensuously abandoned good cry of
her life. The dogwood trees were a glory of flushed white
about her, shining in on every hand through the black-green
cedars, as if the stars had rushed forward toward
earth and clustered more thickly in a nearer midnight sky.
Life had no right to be so overwhelmingly fair&mdash;if these
poignant gusts of beauty gave no sanction to all that the
bruised heart of man might long for of peace and joy!
If life must be accepted as an idiot's tale, signifying nothing,
then it was a refinement of that torture that it could
suddenly lift&mdash;as a sterile wave lifts only to break&mdash;to such
dizzying, ecstatic heights.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, no&mdash;it was impossible!
It was unthinkable! It was absurd!</p>

<p>That year we spent July, August, and early September
in France, but late September found us back in New Haven
for those autumnal weeks which are the golden, heady wine
of our New England cycle. Praise of the New England
October, for those who have experienced it, must always
seem futile, and for those who have not, exaggerated and
false. Summer does not decay in New England; it first
smoulders and then flares out in a clear multicolored glory
of flame; it does not sicken to corruption, it shouts and
sings and is transfigured. I had suggested to Susan, therefore,
a flight to higher hills&mdash;to the Berkshires, to be precise&mdash;where
we might more spaciously watch these smoke-less
frost-fires flicker up, spread, consume themselves, and
at last leap from the crests, to vanish rather than die. But
Susan, pleading a desire to settle down after much wandering,
begged off. She did not tell me that she had a private
sanctuary, too long unvisited, hidden among nearer and
humbler hills.</p>

<p>The rough fields of the old farm were now rich with
crimson and gold&mdash;bright yellow gold, red gold, green and
tarnished gold&mdash;or misted over with the horizon blue of
wild asters, a needed softening of tone in a world else so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
vibrant with light, so nakedly clear. This was another and
perhaps even a deeper intoxication than that of the flood
tide of spring. Unbearably beautiful it grew at its climax
of splendor! An unseen organist unloosed all his stops,
and Susan, like a little child overpowered by that rocking
clamor, was shaken by it and almost whimpered for
mercy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>It was not until the following spring that chance improbably
betrayed her guarded secret to me. All during
the preceding fall I had wondered at times that I found
it so increasingly difficult to arrange for afternoons of
tennis or golf or riding with Susan; but I admonished
myself that as she grew up she must inevitably find personal
interests and younger friends, and it was not for me
to limit or question her freedom. And though Susan never
lied to me, she was clever enough, and woman enough, to
let me mislead myself.</p>

<p>"I've been taking a long walk, Ambo." "I've been
riding."</p>

<p>Well, bless her, so she had&mdash;and why shouldn't she?
Though it came at last with me to a vague, comfortless
feeling of shut-outness&mdash;of too often missing an undefined
something that I had hoped to share.</p>

<p>During a long winter of close companionship in study
and socially unsocial life this feeling disappeared, but with
the spring it gradually formed again, like a little spreading
cloud in an empty sky. And one afternoon, toward
middle May, I discovered myself to be unaccountably alone
and wishing Susan were round&mdash;so we could "do something."
The day was a day apart. Mummies that day, in
dim museums, ached in their cerements. Middle-aged bank
clerks behind grilles knew a sudden unrest, and one or two
of them even wondered whether to be always honestly
handling the false counters of life were any compensation
for never having riotously lived. Little boys along Hillhouse
Avenue, ordinarily well-behaved, turned freakishly
truculent, delighted in combat, and pummelled each other
with ineffective fists. Settled professors in classrooms were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
seized with irrelevant fancies and, while trying to recover
some dropped thread of discourse, openly sighed&mdash;haunted
by visions of the ph&oelig;be bird's nest found under the old
bridge by the mill dam, or of the long-forgotten hazel eyes
of some twelve-year-old sweetheart. A rebellious day&mdash;and
a sentimental! [See Lord Tennyson, and the poets,
<i>passim</i>.] The apple trees must be in full bloom.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Well then, confound it, why had Susan gone to a public
lecture on Masefield? Or had she merely mentioned at
lunch that there was a public lecture on Masefield? Oh,
damn it! One can't stay indoors on such a day!</p>

<p>Susan and I kept our saddle horses at the local riding
academy, where they were well cared for and exercised on
the many days when we couldn't or did not wish to take
them out. As the academy was convenient and had good
locker rooms and showers, we always preferred changing
there instead of dressing at home and having the horses
sent round. Riding is not one of my passions, and oddly
enough is not one of Susan's. That intense sympathy
which unites some men and women to horses, and others
to dogs or cats, is either born in one or it is not. Susan
felt it very strongly for both dogs and cats, and if I have
failed to mention Tumps and Togo, that is a lack in myself,
not in her. I don't dislike dogs or cats or, for that matter,
well-broken horses, but&mdash;though I lose your last shreds of
sympathy&mdash;they all, in comparison with other interests,
leave me more than usual calm. Of Tumps and Togo,
nevertheless, something must yet be said, though too late
for their place in Susan's heart; or indeed, for their own
deserving. But they are already an intrusion here.</p>

<p>For Alma, her dainty little single footer, Susan's feeling
was rather admiration than love. Just as there are poets
whose songs we praise, but whose genius does not seem to
knit itself into the very fabric of our being, so it was with
Alma and Susan. She said and thought nothing but good
of Alma, yet never felt lonely away from her&mdash;the infallible
test. As for Jessica, my own modest nag, I fear she
was very little more to me than an agreeably paced inducement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to exercise, and I fear I was little more to her than
a possible source of lump sugar and a not-too-fretful hand
on the bridle reins. To-day, however, I needed her as a
more poetic motor; failing Susan's companionship, I
wanted to be carried far out into country byways apart
from merely mechanical motors or&mdash;ditto&mdash;men.</p>

<p>Jessica, well up to it, offered no objections to the plan,
and we were soon trotting briskly along the a&euml;rial Ridge
Road, from which we at length descended to the dark eastern
flank of Mount Carmel. It would mean a long pull
to go right round the mountain by the steep back road, and
I had at first no thought of attempting it; but the swift
remembrance of a vast cherry orchard bordering that road
made me wonder whether its blossoms had yet fallen.
When I determined finally to push on, poor Jessica's
earlier fire had cooled; we climbed the rough back road
as a slug moves; the cherry orchard proved disappointing;
and the sun was barely two hours from the hills when we
crossed the divide and turned south down a grass-grown
wood road that I had never before traveled. I hoped, and
no doubt Jessica hoped, it might prove a shorter cut home.</p>

<p>What it did prove was so fresh an enchantment of young
leaf and flashing wing, that I soon ceased to care where it
led or how late I might be for dinner. Then a sharp dip
in the road brought a new vision of delight; dogwood&mdash;cloudy
masses of pink dogwood, the largest, deepest-tinted
trees of it I had ever seen! It caught at my throat; and
I reined in Jessica, whose &aelig;sthetic sense was less developed,
and stared. But presently the spell was broken. An unseen
horse squealed, evidently from behind a great lilac thicket
in an old field at the left, and Jessica squealed back, instantly
alert and restive. The sharp whinnying was
repeated, and Jessica's dancing excitement grew intense;
then there was a scuffling commotion back of the lilacs and
to my final astonishment Susan's little mare, Alma, having
broken her headstall and wrenched herself free of bit and
bridle, came trotting amicably forth to join her old friends&mdash;which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
she could easily do, as the ancient cattle bars at
the field-gate had long since rotted away.</p>

<p>It was unmistakably dainty Alma with her white forehead
star&mdash;but where was her mistress? A finger of ice
drew slowly along my spine as I urged Jessica into the
field and round the lilac thicket. Alma meekly followed
us, softly breathing encouragement through pink nostrils,
and my alarm quieted when I found nothing more dreadful
than the broken bridle still dangling from the branch
of a dead cedar. It was plain that Susan had tied Alma
there to explore on foot through the higher fields; it was
plain, too, that she must have preferred to ride out here
alone, and had been at some pains to conceal her purpose.</p>

<p>For a second, so piqued was I, I almost decided to ride
on and leave the willful child to her own devices. But the
broken bridle shamed me. I dismounted to examine it; it
could be held together safely enough for the return, I saw,
with a piece of stout twine, and there was certain to be a
habitation with a piece of stout twine in it on down the
road somewhere. Susan must have come that way and
could tell me. But I must find her first.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"Susan!" I called. "<i>Oh-ho-o-o! Soo-san!</i>"</p>

<p>No answer. I called again&mdash;vainly. Nothing for it,
then, but a search! I tethered Jessica to the cedar stump,
convinced that Alma wouldn't wander far from her old
friend, and started off through the field past a senile apple
tree bearing a few scattered blossoms, beyond which a
faintly suggested path seemed to lead upward through a
wonder-grove of the pink dogwood, mingled with laurel
and birch and towering cedars. That path, I knew, would
have tempted Susan.</p>

<p>What there was of it soon disappeared altogether in an
under-thicket of high-bush huckleberry, taller than a man's
head. Through this I was pushing my way, and had
stooped to win past some briers and protect my eyes&mdash;when
I felt a silk scarf slip across them, muffling my face.</p>

<p>It was swiftly knotted from behind; then my hand was
taken, and Susan's voice&mdash;on a tone of blended mischief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and mystery&mdash;quavered at my ear: "Hush! Profane
mortal&mdash;speak not! This is holy ground."</p>

<p>With not another word spoken she drew me after her,
guiding me to freer air and supporting me when I stumbled.
We continued thus for some moments, on my part
clumsily enough; and then Susan halted me, and turned
me solemnly round three times, while she crooned in a
weird gypsy-like singsong the following incantation:</p>

<div class='poem'>
<i>Cedar, cedar, birch and fern,</i><br />
<i>Turn his wits as mine you turn.</i><br />
<br />
<i>If he sees what now I see</i><br />
<i>Welcome shall this mortal be.</i><br />
<br />
<i>If he sees it not, I'll say</i><br />
<i>Crick-crack and vanish May!</i><br />
</div>

<p>But I must have seen! My initiation was pronounced
successful. From that hour all veils were withdrawn, and
I was made free of the magic circle.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>It was a dip in Lethe. Dinner was forgotten&mdash;the long
miles home and the broken bridle. A powerful enchantment
had done its work. For me, only the poised moment
of joy was real. Nothing else mattered, nothing else
existed, while that poised fragile moment was mine. We
talked or were silent&mdash;it was all one. And when dusk
crept in, and a grateful wood-thrush praised it, we still
lingered to join in that praise.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then a whippoorwill
began to call insistently, grievously, from very far off. It
was the whippoorwill that shattered my poised crystal
moment of perfect joy.</p>

<p>"Those poor horses," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Susan, springing up, "how <i>could</i> we let
them starve! I'm starved, too, Ambo&mdash;aren't you? What
sillies we are!"</p>

<p>We got home safely, after some trifling difficulties, past
ten o'clock.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
<i>When the lamp is shattered</i><br />
<i>The light in the dust lies dead&mdash;&mdash;</i><br />
</div>

<p>Only it doesn't, always&mdash;thank God! Memories.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
And this was but one. Oh, no; I was not to be alone. I
should never really be alone.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>The morning after Jimmy had dined with us, Susan,
at my request, brought Miss Goucher to my study, and
we had a good long talk together. And first of all the problem
of Gertrude loomed before us, starting up ghostlike
at a chance remark, and then barring all progress with
more practical considerations, till laid. Neither Susan's
telegram nor her private interview with Gertrude had been
discussed between us; I had nervously shied off from both
matters in my dread of seeming to question Susan's
motives. But now Susan herself, to put it crudely, insisted
on a show-down.</p>

<p>"The air needed clearing, Ambo, and I sent the telegram
hoping to clear it by raising a storm. But, as Sister reminded
me at breakfast, storms don't always clear the air&mdash;even
good hard ones; they sometimes leave it heavier
than ever. I'm afraid that's what my storm has done.
Has it, Ambo? What happened when Mrs. Hunt came to
see you here? But perhaps I ought to tell you first what
happened between us?"</p>

<p>"No," I smiled; "Gertrude made that fairly plain, for
once. And your storm did sweep off the worst of the fog!
You see, Gertrude has, intensely, the virtues of her defects&mdash;a
fastidious sense of honor among them. Once she felt
her suspicions unjust, she was bound to acknowledge it. I
can't say you won a friend, but you did&mdash;by some miracle&mdash;placate
a dangerous foe."</p>

<p>"Is she coming back to you, Ambo?"</p>

<p>"No. She suggests divorce. But that of course is impossible!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Is it kind to ask?" said Miss Goucher. "And&mdash;forgive
me, dear&mdash;after your decision, is it necessary for you to
know?"</p>

<p>Susan reflected anxiously. "No," she finally responded,
"it isn't kind; but it is necessary. I'll tell you why,
Ambo. If you had been free, I think there's no doubt I
should have married you. Oh, I know, dear, it sounds cold-blooded
like that! But the point is, I shouldn't then have
questioned things as I do now. My feeling for you&mdash;your
need of me&mdash;they wouldn't have been put to the test. Now
they have been&mdash;or rather, they're being tested, every minute
of every hour. Suppose I should ask you now&mdash;meaning
every word of it&mdash;to divorce Mrs. Hunt so you could marry
me? At least you'd know then, wouldn't you, that simply
being yours meant more to me than anything else in life?
Or suppose I couldn't bring myself to ask it, but couldn't
face life without you? Suppose I drowned myself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good God, dear!"</p>

<p>"I'm not going to, Ambo&mdash;and what's equally important,
neither are you. Why, you don't even pause over
Mrs. Hunt's suggestion! You don't even wait to ask my
opinion! You say at once&mdash;it's impossible! That proves
something, doesn't it&mdash;about you and me? It either proves
we're not half so much in love as we think we are, or else
that love isn't for either of us the only good thing in life&mdash;the
whole show." She paused, but added: "Why can't
you consider divorcing Mrs. Hunt, Ambo? After all, she
isn't honestly your wife and doesn't want to be; it would
only be common fairness to yourself."</p>

<p>Miss Goucher stirred uneasily in her chair. I stirred
uneasily in mine.</p>

<p>"There are so many reasons," I fumbled. "I suppose
at bottom it comes to this&mdash;a queer feeling of responsibility,
of guilt even.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" cried Susan. "You never could have satisfied
her, Ambo. You weren't born to be human, but somehow,
in spite of everything, you just are! It's your worst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
fault in Mrs. Hunt's eyes. Mrs. Hunt shouldn't have married
a man; she should have married a social tradition; an
abstract idea."</p>

<p>"How could she?" asked Miss Goucher.</p>

<p>"Easily," said Susan; "she's one herself, so there must
be others. It's hard to believe, but apparently abstractions
like that do get themselves incarnated now and then. I
never met one before&mdash;in the flesh. It gave me a creepy
feeling&mdash;like shaking hands with the fourth dimension or
asking the Holy Roman Empire to dinner. But I don't
pretend to make her out, Ambo. Why <i>did</i> she leave you?
It seems the very thing an incarnate social tradition could
never have brought herself to do!"</p>

<p>Before I could check myself I reproved her. "You're
not often merely cruel, Susan!" Then, hoping to soften
it, I hurried on: "You see, dear, Gertrude isn't greatly
to blame. Suppose you had been born and brought up like
her, to believe beauty and brains and a certain gracious
way of life a family privilege, a class distinction. Don't
you see how your inbred worship of class and family
would become in the end an intenser form of worshipping
yourself? Gertrude was taught to live exclusively, from
girlhood, in this disguised worship of her own perfections.
We're all egotists of course; but most of us are the common
or garden variety, and have an occasional suspicion
that we're pretty selfish and intolerant and vain. Gertrude
has never suspected it. How could she? A daughter of
her house can do no wrong&mdash;and she is a daughter of her
house." I sighed.</p>

<p>"Unluckily, my power of unreserved admiration has
bounds, and my tongue and temper sometimes haven't. So
our marriage dissolved in an acid bath compounded of
honest irritations and dishonest apologies. <i>I</i> made the dishonest
apologies. To do Gertrude justice, she never apologized.
She knew the initial fault was mine. I shouldn't
have joined a church whose creed I couldn't repeat without
a sensation of moral nausea. That's just what I did when
I married Gertrude. There was no deception on her side,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
either. I knew her gods, and I knew she assumed that
mine were the same as hers, and that I was humbly entering
the service of their dedicated priestess. Well, I apostatized&mdash;to
her frozen amazement. Then a crisis came&mdash;insignificant
enough.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Gertrude refused to call with
me on the bride of an old friend of mine, because she
thought it a misalliance. He had no right, she held, under
her jealous gods, to bring a former trained nurse home as
his wife, and thrust her upon a society that would never
otherwise have received her.</p>

<p>"I was furious, and blasphemed her gods. I insisted
she should either accompany me, then and there, or I'd go
myself and apologize for her&mdash;yes, these are the words I
used&mdash;her 'congenital lunacy.' She left me like a statue
walking, and went to her room."</p>

<p>"And you?" asked Susan.</p>

<p>"I made the call."</p>

<p>"Did you make the apology?"</p>

<p>"No; I couldn't."</p>

<p>"Naturally not," assented Miss Goucher.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ambo," protested Susan, "what a coward you
are! Well, and then?"</p>

<p>"I returned to a wifeless house. From that hour until
yesterday morning there have been no explanations between
Gertrude and me. Gertrude is superb."</p>

<p>"I understand her less than ever," said Susan.</p>

<p>"I understand her quite well," said Miss Goucher.
"But your long silence, Mr. Hunt&mdash;that I can't understand."</p>

<p>"I can," Susan exclaimed. "Ambo's very bones dislike
her. So do mine. Do you remember how I used to shock
you, Ambo, when I first came here&mdash;saying somebody or
other was no damn good? Well, I can't help it; it's
stronger than I am. Mrs. Hunt's no&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>child!</i>" struck in Miss Goucher. "How much you
have still to learn!" Then she addressed me: "I've never
seen a more distinguished person than Mrs. Hunt. I know
it's odd, coming from me, but somehow I sympathize with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
her&mdash;greatly. I've always"&mdash;hesitated Miss Goucher&mdash;"been
a proud sort of nobody myself."</p>

<p>Susan reached over and slipped her hand into Miss
Goucher's. "Poor Sister! Just as we're going off together
you begin to find out how horrid I can be. But I'll make
a little true confession to both of you. What I've been saying
about Mrs. Hunt isn't in the least what I think about
her. The fact is, I'm jealous of her, in so many ways&mdash;except
in the ordinary way! To make a clean breast of
it, when I was with her she brought me to my knees in spite
of myself. Oh, I acknowledge her power! It's uncanny.
How did you ever find strength to resist it, Ambo? My
outbreak was sheer Birch Street bravado&mdash;a cheap insult
flung in the face of the unattainable! It was all my shortcomings
throwing mud at all her disdain. Truly! Why,
the least droop of her eyelids taught me that it takes more
than quick wits and sensitive nerves and hard study to
overcome a false start&mdash;or rather, no start at all!</p>

<p>"Birch Street isn't even a beginning, because, so far as
Mrs. Hunt's concerned, Birch Street simply doesn't exist!
And even Birch Street would have to admit that she gets
away with it! I'd say so, too, if I didn't go a step farther
and feel that it gets away with her. That's why ridicule
can't touch her. You can't laugh at a devotee, a woman
possessed, the instrument of a higher power! Mrs. Hunt's
a living confession of faith in the absolute rightness of the
right people, and a living rebuke to the incurable wrongness
of the wrong! Oh, I knew at once what you meant,
Ambo, when you called her a dedicated priestess! It's the
way I shall always think of her&mdash;ritually clothed, and
pouring out tea to her gods from sacred vessels of colonial
silver! You can smile, Ambo, but I shall; and way down
in my common little Birch Street heart, I believe I shall
always secretly envy her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. So there!"</p>

<p>For the first time in my remembrance of her, Miss
Goucher laughed out loud. Her laugh&mdash;in effect, not in
resonance&mdash;was like cockcrow. We all laughed together,
and Gertrude vanished.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But ten minutes later found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
us with knit brows again, locked in debate. Susan had at
length seized courage to tell me that when she left my
house she must, once and for all, go it completely alone.
She could no longer accept my financial protection. She
was to stand on her own feet, for better or worse, richer or
poorer, in sickness or in health. This staggering proposal
I simply could not listen to calmly, and would not yield to!
It was too preposterously absurd.</p>

<p>Yet I made no headway with my objections, until I
stumbled upon the one argument that served me and led
to a final compromise, "Dear," I had protested, really
and deeply hurt by Susan's stubborn stand for absolute
independence, "can't you feel how cruelly unkind all this
is to me?"</p>

<p>"Oh," she wailed, "unkind? Why did you say that!
Surely, Ambo, you don't mean it! Unkind?"</p>

<p>I was quick to press my advantage. "When you ask me
to give up even the mere material protection of my family?
You <i>are</i> my family, Susan&mdash;all the family I shall ever
have. I don't want to be maudlin about it. I don't wish
to interfere with your freedom to develop your own life in
your own way. But it's beyond my strength not to plead
that all that's good in my life is bound up with yours.
Please don't ask me to live in daily and hourly anxiety
over your reasonable comfort and health. There's no common
sense in it, Susan. It's fantastic! And it is unkind!"</p>

<p>Susan could not long resist this plea, for she felt its
wretched sincerity, even if she knew&mdash;as she later told me&mdash;that
I was making the most of it. It was Miss Goucher
who suggested our compromise.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hunt," she said, "my own arrangement with
Susan is this: We are to pool our resources, and I am to
make a home for her, just as if I were her own mother.
I've been able to save, during the past twenty-five years,
about eight thousand dollars; it's well invested, I think,
and brings me in almost five hundred a year. This is what
we were to start with; and Susan feels certain she can earn
at least two thousand dollars a year by her pen. I know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
nothing of the literary market, but I haven't counted on
her being able to earn so much&mdash;for a year or so, at least.
On the other hand, I feel certain Susan will finally make
her way as a writer. So I'd counted on using part of my
capital for a year or two if necessary. We plan to live
very simply for the present, of course&mdash;but without hardship."</p>

<p>"Still&mdash;&mdash;" I would have protested, if for once Miss
Goucher had not waived all deference, sailing calmly on:</p>

<p>"As Susan has told you, she's convinced that she needs
the assurance of power and self-respect to be gained by
meeting life without fear or favor and making her own
career in the face of whatever difficulties arise. There's a
good deal to be said for that, Mr. Hunt&mdash;more than you
could be expected to understand. Situated as you have
always been, I mean. But naturally, as Susan's guardian,
you can't be expected to stand aside if for any
reason we fail in our attempt. I see that; and Susan sees
it now, I'm sure. Yet I really feel I must urge you to let
us try. And I promise faithfully to keep you informed as
to just how we are getting on."</p>

<p>"Please, Ambo," Susan chimed in, "let us try. If things
go badly I won't be unreasonable or stubborn&mdash;indeed I
won't. Please trust me for that. I'll even go a step
farther than Sister. I won't let her break into her savings&mdash;not
one penny. If it ever comes to that, I'll come
straight to you. And for the immediate present, I have
over five hundred dollars in my bank account; and"&mdash;she
smiled&mdash;"I'll try to feel it's honestly mine. You've spent
heaven knows how much on me, Ambo; though it's the
least of all you've done for me and been to me! But now,
please let me see whether I could ever have made anything
of myself if I hadn't been so shamelessly lucky&mdash;if life had
treated me as it treats most people.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Jimmy, for instance.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<i>He</i> hasn't needed help, Ambo; and I simply
must know whether he's a better man than I am, Gunga
Dhin! Don't you see?"</p>

<p>Yes; I flatter myself that I did, more or less mistily,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
begin to see. Thus our morning conference drew to its
dreary, amicable close.</p>

<p>But from the door Susan turned back to me with tragic
eyes: "Ambo&mdash;I'm caring. It does&mdash;hurt." And since I
could not very safely reply, she attempted a smile. "Ambo&mdash;what
is to become of poor Tumps? Togo will have to
come; I can't reduce him to atheism. But Tumps would
die in New York; and he never has believed in God anyway!
Can you make a martyr of yourself for his surly
sake? Can you? Just to see, I mean, that he gets his milk
every day and fish heads on Friday? Can you, dear?"</p>

<p>I nodded and turned away.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The door closed so quietly
that I first knew when the latch ticked once how fortunately
I was alone.</p>


<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>Maltby Phar was responsible for Togo; he had given
him&mdash;a little black fluff-ball with shoe-button eyes&mdash;to
Susan, about six months after she first came to live with
me. Togo is a Chow; and a Chow is biologically classified
as a dog. But if a Chow is a dog, then a Russian sable
muff is a dish rag. Your Chow&mdash;black, smoke blue, or red&mdash;is
a creation apart. He is to dogdom what Hillhouse
Avenue is to Birch Street&mdash;the wrong end, <i>bien entendu</i>.
His blood is so blue that his tongue is purple; and, like
Susan's conception of Gertrude, he is a living confession
of faith in the rightness of the right people, a living rebuke
to the wrongness of the wrong; the right people being,
of course, that master god or mistress goddess whom he
worships, with their immediate <i>entourage</i>. No others need
apply for even cursory notice, much less respect.</p>

<p>I am told they eat Chows in China, their native land.
If they do, it must be from the motive that drove Plutarch's
Athenian to vote the banishment of Aristides&mdash;ennui,
to wit, kindling to rage; he had wearied to madness
of hearing him always named "the Just." Back, too,
in America&mdash;for I write from France&mdash;there will one day
be proletarian reprisals against the Chow; for in the art<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of cutting one dead your Chow is supreme. He goes by
you casually, on tiptoe, with the glazed eye of indifference.
He sees you and does not see you&mdash;and will not.
You may cluck, you may whistle, you may call; interest
will not excite him, nor flattery move him; he passes; he
"goes his unremembering way." But let him beware!
If Americans are slow to anger, they are terrible when
roused. I have frequently explained this to Togo&mdash;more
for Susan's sake than his own&mdash;and been yawned at for
my pains.</p>

<p>Personally, I have no complaint to make. In Togo's
eyes I am one of the right people. He has always treated
me with a certain tact, though with a certain reserve.
Only to Susan does he prostrate himself with an almost
mystical ecstasy of devotion. Only for her does his feathered
tail-arc quiver, do his ears lie back, his calm ebon lips
part in an unmistakably adoring smile. But there is much
else, I admit, to be said for him; he never barks his deep
menacing bark without cause; and as a mere <i>objet d'art</i>,
when well combed, he is superb. Ming porcelains are
nothing to him; he is perhaps the greatest decorative
achievement of the unapproachably decorative East.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>But for Tumps, my peculiar legacy, I have nothing good
to say and no apologies to offer. Like Calverley's parrot,
he still lives&mdash;"he will not die." Tumps is a tomcat. And
not only is he a tomcat, he is a hate-scarred noctivagant,
owning but an ear and a half, and a poor third of tail. His
design was botched at birth, and has since been degraded;
his color is unpleasant; his expression is ferocious&mdash;and
utterly sincere. He has no friends in the world but Susan
and Sonia, and Sonia cannot safely keep him with her
because of the children.</p>

<p>Out of the night he came, shortly after Togo's arrival;
starved for once into submission and dragging himself
across the garden terrace to Susan's feet. And she accepted
this devil's gift, this household scourge. I never
did, nor did Togo; but we were finally subdued by fear.
Those baleful eyes cursing us from dim corners&mdash;Togo,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Togo, shall we ever forget them! Separately or together,
we have more than once failed to enter a dusky room,
toward twilight, where those double phosphors burned from
your couch corner or out from beneath my easy-chair.</p>

<p>But nothing would move Susan to give Tumps up so
long as he cared to remain; and Tumps cared. Small wonder!
Nursed back to health and rampageous vivacity, he
soon mastered the neighborhood, peopled it with his ill-favored
offspring, and wailed his obscene balladry to the
moon. Hillhouse Avenue protested, <i>en bloc</i>. The Misses
Carstairs, whose slumbers had more than once been postponed,
and whose white Persian, Desdemona, had been
debauched, threatened traps, poison and the law. Professor
Emeritus Gillingwater attempted murder one night
with a .22 rifle, but only succeeded in penetrating the glass
roof of his neighbor's conservatory.</p>

<p>Susan was unmoved, defending her own; she would not
listen to any plea, and she mocked at reprisals. Those were
the early days of her coming, when I could not force myself
to harsh measures; and happily Tumps, having lost
some seven or eight lives, did with the years grow more
sedate, though no more amiable. But the point is, he
stayed&mdash;and, I repeat, lives to this hour on my distant,
grudging bounty.</p>

<p>Such was the charge lightly laid upon me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Oh, Susan&mdash;Susan! For once, resentment will out!
May you suffer, shamed to contrition, as you read these
lines! Tumps&mdash;and I say it now boldly&mdash;is "no damn
good."</p>


<h3>XV</h3>

<p>I am clinging to this long chapter as if I were still clinging
to Susan's hand on the wind-swept station platform,
hoarding time by infinitesimally split seconds, dreading
her inevitable escape. Phil&mdash;by request, I suspect&mdash;did
not come down; and Susan forbade me to enter the train
with her, having previously forbidden me to accompany
her to town. Togo was forward, amid crude surroundings,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
riling the brakemen with his disgusted disdain. Miss
Goucher had already said a decorous but sincerely felt
good-by, and had taken her place inside.</p>

<p>"Let's not be silly, Ambo," Susan whispered. "After
all, you'll be down soon&mdash;won't you? You're always running
to New York."</p>

<p>Then, unexpectedly, she snatched her hand from mine,
threw her arms tight round my neck, and for a reckless
public moment sobbed and kissed me. With that she was
gone.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I turned, too, at once, meaning flight from the
curious late-comers pressing toward the car steps. One
of them distinctly addressed me.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Ambrose. Don't worry about your
charming little ward. She'll be quite safe&mdash;away from
you. I'll keep a friendly eye on her going down."</p>

<p>It was Lucette.</p>

<h2>THE FOURTH CHAPTER</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<div class='cap'>I &nbsp;HAD a long conference with Phil the day after Susan's
departure, and we solemnly agreed that we must,
within reasonable limits, give Susan a clear field; her desire
to play a lone hand in the cut-throat poker game called
life must be, so far as possible, respected. But we sneakingly
evaded any definition of our terms. "Within reasonable
limits;" "so far as possible"&mdash;the vagueness of these
phrases will give you the measure of our secret duplicity.</div>

<p>Meanwhile we lived on from mail delivery to mail delivery,
and Susan proved a faithful correspondent. There
is little doubt, I think, that the length and frequency of her
letters constituted a deliberate sacrifice of energy and time,
laid&mdash;not reluctantly, but not always lightly&mdash;on the altar
of affection. It was a genuine, yet must often have been
an arduous piety. To write full life-giving letters late at
night, after long hours of literary labor, is no trifling
effort of good will&mdash;good will, in this instance, to two of
the loneliest, forlornest of men. Putting aside the mere
anodyne of work we had but one other effective consolation&mdash;Jimmy;
our increasing interest and joy in Jimmy. But,
for me at least, this was not an immediate consolation; my
taste for Jimmy's prosaic companionship was very gradually
acquired.</p>

<p>Our first word from Susan was a day letter, telephoned
to me from the telegraph office, though I at once demanded
the delivery of a verbatim copy by messenger. Here it is:</p>

<p>"<i>At grand central safe so far new york lies roaring just
beyond sister and togo tarry with the stuff near cab stand
while I send. Love Mrs. Arthur snooped in vain now for
it courage Susan whos afraid dont you be alonsen fan.</i>"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Phil, the scholar, interpreted the last two verbatim symbols:
"<i>Allons, enfants!</i>"</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">Susan to Me</span></div>

<p>"Sister and I are at the nice old mid-Victorian Brevoort
House for three or four days. Sister is calmly and courageously
hunting rooms for us&mdash;or, if not rooms, a room.
She hopes for the plural. We like this quarter of town.
It's near enough publishers and things for walking, and
it's not quite so New Yorky as some others. What Sister
is trying to avoid for us is slavery to the Subway,
which is awful! But we may have to fly up beyond Columbia,
or even to the Bronx, before we're through. The hotel
objected to Togo, but I descended to hitherto untried depths
of feminine wheedle&mdash;and justified them by getting my
way. Sister blushed for me&mdash;and herself&mdash;but has since
felt more confident about my chances for success in this
wickedly opportunist world.</p>

<p>"Better skip this part if you read extracts to Phil; he'll
brood. But perhaps you'd better begin disillusioning him
at once, for I'm discovering dreadful possibilities in my
nature&mdash;now the Hillhouse inhibitions seem remote. New
York, one sees overnight, is no place for a romantic idealist&mdash;Maltby's
phrase, not mine, bless Phil's heart!&mdash;but
luckily I've never been one. Birch Street is going to stand
me in good stead down here. New York <i>is</i> Birch Street
on a slightly exaggerated scale; Hillhouse Avenue is something
entirely different. Finer too, perhaps; but the
world's future has its roots in New Birch Street. I began
to feel that yesterday during my first hunt for a paying
job.</p>

<p>"I've plunged on shop equipment, since Jimmy says,
other things being equal, the factory with the best tools wins&mdash;that
is, I've bought a reliable typewriter, and I tackled
my first two-finger exercises last night. The results were
dire&mdash;mostly interior capitals and extraneous asterisks. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
shan't have patience to take proper five-finger lessons.
Sister vows she's going to master the wretched thing too,
so she can help with copying now and then. There's a
gleam in her eye, dear&mdash;wonderful! This is to be her great
adventure as well as mine. 'Susan, Sister &amp; Co., Unlicensed
Hacks&mdash;Piffle While You Wait!' Oh, we shall get
on&mdash;you'll see. Still, I can't truthfully report much progress
yesterday or to-day, though a shade more to-day than
yesterday. I've been counting callously on Maltby, as
Phil disapprovingly knows, and I brought three short
manufactured-in-advance articles for the Garden Ex. down
with me. So my first step was to stifle my last maidenly
scruple and take them straight to Maltby; I hoped they
would pay at least for the typewriter. It was a clear ice-bath
of a morning, and the walk up Fifth Avenue braced
me for anything. I stared at everybody and a good many
unattached males stared back; sometimes I rather liked
it, and sometimes not. It all depends.</p>

<p>"But I found the right building at last, somewhere between
the Waldorf and the Public Library. There's a
shop on its avenue front for the sale of false pearls, and
judging from the shop they must be more expensive than
real ones. Togo dragged me in there at first by mistake;
and as I was wearing my bestest tailor-made and your furs,
and as Togo was wearing his, plus his haughtiest atmosphere,
we seemed between us to be just the sort of thing the
languid clerks had been waiting for. There was a hopeful
stir as we entered&mdash;no, swept in! I was really sorry to
disappoint them; it was horrid to feel that we couldn't live
up to their expectations.</p>

<p>"We didn't sweep out nearly so well! But we found
the elevator round the corner and were taken up four or
five floors, passing a designer of <i>de luxe</i> corsets and a distiller
of <i>de luxe</i> perfumes on the way, and landed in the
impressive outer office of the Garden Ex.</p>

<p>"But how stupid of me to describe all this! You've
been there twenty times, of course, and remember the
apple-green art-crafty furniture and potted palms and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
things. Several depressed-looking persons were fidgeting
about, but my engraved card&mdash;score one for Hillhouse!&mdash;soon
brought Maltby puffing out to me with both hands
extended. Togo didn't quite cut him dead, but almost,
and he insulted an entire roomful of stenographers on his
way to the great man's sanctum. My first <i>sanctum</i>, Ambo!
I did get a little thrill from that, in spite of Maltby.</p>

<p>"Stop chattering, Susan&mdash;stick to facts. Yes, Phil,
please. Fact One: Maltby was surprisingly flustered at
first. He was, Ambo! He jumped to the conclusion that I
was down for shopping or the theaters, and assumed of
course you were with me. So you were, dear&mdash;our way!
But I thought Maltby asked rather gingerly after you.
Why?</p>

<p>"Fact Two: I did my best to explain things, but Maltby
doesn't believe yet I'm serious&mdash;seemingly he can't believe
it, because he doesn't want to. That's always true of
Maltby. He still thinks this must be a sudden spasm&mdash;not
of virtue; thinks I've run away for an unholy lark. It
suits him to think so. If I'm out on the loose he hopes
to manage the whole <i>Mardi gras</i>, and he needn't hear what
I say about needing work too distinctly. That merely annoyed
him. But I did finally make him promise&mdash;while he
wriggled&mdash;to read my three articles and give me a decision
on them to-morrow. I had to promise to lunch with him
then to make even that much headway.&mdash;Oof!</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, I fared slightly better to-day. I took your
letter to Mr. Sampson. The sign, Garnett &amp; Co., almost
frightened me off, though, Ambo; and you know I'm not
easily frightened. But I've read so many of their books&mdash;wonderful
books! I knew great men had gone before
me into those dingy offices and left their precious manuscripts
to strengthen and delight the world. Who was I
to follow those footsteps? Luckily an undaunted messenger
boy whistled on in ahead of me&mdash;so I followed his instead!
By the time I had won past all the guardians of
the <i>sanctum sanctorum</i>, my sentimental fit was over. Birch
Street was herself again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"And Mr. Sampson proved all you promised&mdash;rather
more! The dearest odd old man, full of blunt kindness
and sudden whimsy. I think he liked me. I know I liked
him. But he didn't like me as I did him&mdash;at first sight.
Togo's fault, of course. Why didn't you tell me Mr.
Sampson has a democratic prejudice against aristocratic
dogs? I must learn to leave poor Togo at home&mdash;if there
ever is such a place!&mdash;when I'm looking for work; I may
even have to give up your precious soul-and-body-warming
furs. Between them, they belie every humble petition I
utter. Sister and I may have to eat Togo yet.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sampson only began to relent when I told him a
little about Birch Street. I didn't tell him much&mdash;just
enough to counteract the furs and Togo. And he forgave
me everything when I told him of Sister and confessed
what we were hoping to do&mdash;found a home together and
earn our own right to make it a comfy one to live in. He
questioned me pretty sharply, too, but not from snifty-snoops
like Mrs. Arthur.</p>

<p>"By the way, dear, she was on the train coming down,
as luck would have it, in the chair just across from mine.
Her questions were masterpieces, but nothing to my replies.
I was just wretched enough to scratch without mercy; it
relieved my feelings. But you'd better avoid her for a
week or two&mdash;if you can! I didn't mind any of Mr. Sampson's
questions, though I eluded some of them, being young
in years but old in guile. I'm to take him my poems to-morrow
afternoon, and some bits of prose things&mdash;the ones
you liked. They're not much more than fragments, I'm
afraid. He says he wants to get the hang of me before
loading me down with bad advice. I do like him, and&mdash;the
serpent having trailed its length all over this endless letter&mdash;I
truly think his offhand friendship may prove far more
helpful to me than Maltby's&mdash;&mdash;! <i>You</i> can fill in the
blank, Ambo. My shamelessness has limits, even now, in
darkest New York.</p>

<p>"Good night, dear. Please don't think you are ever far
from my me-est thoughts. Now for that &mdash;&mdash; typewriter!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">Susan to Jimmy</span></div>

<p>"That's a breath-taking decision you've made, but like
you; and I'm proud of you for having made it&mdash;and
prouder that the idea was entirely your own. I suppose
we're all bound to be more or less lopsided in a world
slightly flattened at the poles and rather wobbly on its axis
anyway. But the less lopsided we are the better for us,
and the better for us the better for others&mdash;and that's
one universal law, at least, that doesn't make me long for
a universal recall and referendum.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're right to stay on at Yale, but so much
righter to have decided on a broad general course instead
of a narrow technical one! <i>Of course</i> you can carry on
your technical studies by yourself! With your brain's
natural twist and the practical training you've had, probably
carry them much farther by yourself than under direction!
And the way you've chosen will open vistas,
bring the sky through the jungle to you. It was brave
of you to see that and take the first difficult step. "<i>Il n'y
a que le premier pas qui co&ucirc;te</i>"&mdash;but no wonder you hesitated!
Because at your advanced age, Jimmy, and from
an efficient point of view, it's a downright silly step, wasteful
of time&mdash;and time you know's money&mdash;and money you
know's everything. Only, I'm afraid you <i>don't</i> know that
intensely enough ever to have a marble mansion on upper
Fifth Avenue, a marble villa at Newport, a marble bungalow
at Palm Beach, a marble steam yacht&mdash;but they don't
make those of marble, do they!</p>

<p>"It's so possible for you to collect all these marbles,
Jimmy&mdash;reelers, every one of them!&mdash;if you'll only start
now and do nothing else for the next thirty or forty years.
You can be a poor boy who became infamous just as easy
as pie! Simply forget the world's so full of a number of
things, and grab all you can of just one. But I could hug<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
you for wanting to be a man, not an adding-machine!
For caring to know why Socrates was richer than Morgan,
and why Saint Francis and Sainte-Beuve, each in his own
way, have helped more to make life worth living than all
the Rothschilds of Europe! Oh, I know it's a paradox for
me to preach this, when here am I trying to collect a few
small clay marbles&mdash;putting every ounce of concentration
in me on money making, on material success! Not getting
far with it, either&mdash;so far.</p>

<p>"But what I'm doing, Jimmy, is just what you've set
out to do&mdash;I'm trying not to be lopsided. You've met
life as it is, already; I never have. And I'd so love to moon
along pleasantly on Ambo's inherited money&mdash;read books
and write verses and look at flowers and cats and stars and
trees and children and cows and chickens and funny dogs
and donkeys and funnier women and men! I'd so like
not to adjust myself to an industrial civilization; not to
worry over that sort of thing at all; above everything, not
to earn my daily bread. I could cry about having to make
up my mind on such bristly beasts as economic or social
problems!</p>

<p>"The class struggle bores me to tears&mdash;yet here it is,
we're up against it; and I <i>won't</i> be lopsided! What I want
is pure thick cream, daintily fed to me, too, from a hand-beaten
spoon. So I mustn't have it unless I can get it.
And I don't know that I can&mdash;you see, it isn't all conscience
that's driving me; curiosity's at work as well! But
it's scrumptious to know we're both studying the same
thing in a different way&mdash;the one great subject, after all:
How not to be lopsided! How to be perfectly spherical,
like the old man in the nonsense rhyme. Not wobbly on
one's axis&mdash;not even slightly flattened at the poles!"</p>

<p>"<i>Hurrah for us! Trumpets!</i></p>

<p>"But I'm gladdest of all that you and Ambo are beginning
at last to be friends. You don't either of you say
so&mdash;it drifts through; and I could sing about it&mdash;if I could
sing. There isn't anybody in the world like Ambo.</p>

<p>"As for Sister and me, we're getting on, and we're<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
not. Sister thinks I've done marvels; I know she has.
Marvels of economy and taste in cozying up our room, marvels
of sympathy and canny advice that doesn't sound like
advice at all. As one-half of a mutual-admiration syndicate
I'm a complete success! But as a professional author&mdash;hum,
hum. Anyway, I'm beginning to poke my inquisitive
nose into a little of everything, and you can't tell&mdash;something,
some day, may come of this. As the Dickens
man said&mdash;who was he?&mdash;I hope it mayn't be human gore.
Meanwhile, one thing hits the most casual eye: We're still
in the double-room-with-alcove boarding-house stage, and
likely to stay there for some time to come."</p>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">Susan To Phil</span></div>

<p>"Your short letter answering my long one has been
read and reread and read again. I know it by heart.
Everything you say's true&mdash;and isn't. I'll try to explain
that&mdash;for I can't bear you to be doubting me. You are,
Phil. I don't blame you, but I do blame myself&mdash;for complacency.
I've taken too much for granted, as I always
do with you and Ambo. You see, I know so intensely
that you and Ambo are pure gold&mdash;incorruptible!&mdash;that I
couldn't possibly question anything you might say or do&mdash;the
fineness of the motive, I mean. If you did murder
and were hanged for it, and even if I'd no clue as to why
you struck&mdash;I should know all the time you must have done
it because, for some concealed reason, under circumstances
dark to the rest of us, your clear eyes marked it as the
one possible right thing to do.</p>

<p>"Yes, I trust you like that, Phil; you and Ambo and
Sister and Jimmy. Think of trusting four people like that!
How rich I am! And you can't know how passionately
grateful! For it isn't blind trusting at all. In each one
of you I've touched a soul of goodness. There's no other
name for it. It's as simple as fresh air. You're good&mdash;you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
four&mdash;good from the center. But, Phil dear, a little
secret to comfort you&mdash;just between us and the stars: So,
mostly, am I.</p>

<p>"Truly, Phil, I'm ridiculously good at the center, and
most of the way out. There are things I simply can't do,
no matter how much I'd like to; and lots of oozy, opally
things I simply can't like at all. I'm with you so far, at
least&mdash;peacock-proud to be! But we're tremendously different,
all the same. It's really this, I think: You're a
Puritan, by instinct and cultivation; and I'm not. The
clever ones down here, you know, spend most of their
spare time swearing by turns at Puritanism and the Victorian
Era. Their favorite form of exercise is patting
themselves on the back, and this is one of their subtler
ways of doing it. But they just rampantly rail; they
don't&mdash;though they think they do&mdash;understand. They mix
up every <i>pass&eacute;</i> narrowness and bigotry and hypocrisy and
sentimental cant in one foul stew, and then rush from it,
with held noses, screaming "Puritanism! <i>Faugh!</i>" Well,
it does, Phil&mdash;their stew! So, often, for that matter&mdash;and
to high heaven&mdash;do the clever ones!</p>

<p>"But it isn't Puritanism, the real thing. You see, I
know the real thing&mdash;for I know you. Ignorance, bigotry,
hypocrisy, sentimentalism&mdash;such things have no part in
your life. And yet you're a Puritan, and I'm not. Something
divides us where we are most alike. What is it,
Phil?</p>

<p>"May I tell you? I almost dare believe I've puzzled it
out.</p>

<p>"You're a simon-Puritan, dear, because you won't trust
that central goodness, your own heart; the very thing in
you on whose virgin-goldness I would stake my life! You
won't trust it in yourself; and when you find it in others,
you don't fully trust it in them. You've purged your
philosophy of Original Sin, but it still secretly poisons the
marrow of your bones. You guard your soul's strength
as possible weakness&mdash;something that might vanish suddenly,
at a pinch. How silly of you! For it's the <i>you</i>-est<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
you, the thing you can never change or escape. Instead
of worrying over yourself or others&mdash;me?&mdash;you could safely
spread yourself, Phil dear, all over the landscape, lie back
in the lap of Mother Earth and twiddle your toes and
smile! Walt Whitman's way! He may have overdone
it now and then, posed about it; but I'm on his side, not
yours. It's heartier&mdash;human-er&mdash;more fun! Yes, Master
Puritan&mdash;more fun! That's a life value you've mostly
missed. But it's never too late, Phil, for a genuine cosmic
spree.</p>

<p>"Now I've done scolding back at you for scolding at me.&mdash;But
I loved your sermon. I hope you won't shudder over
mine?"</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>The above too-cryptic letter badly needs authoritative
annotation, which I now proceed to give you&mdash;at perilous
length. But it will lead us far.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Though it is positively not true that Phil and I, having
covenanted on a hands-off policy, were independently hoping
for the worst, so far as Susan's ability to cope unaided
with New York was concerned; nevertheless, the ease with
which she made her way there, found her feet without us
and danced ahead, proved for some reason oddly disturbing
to us both. Here was a child, of high talents certainly,
perhaps of genius&mdash;the like, at least, of whose mental precocity
we had never met with in any other daughter&mdash;much
less, son&mdash;of Eve! A woman, for we so loved her, endowed
as are few women; yet assuredly a child, for she had but
just counted twenty years on earth. And being men of
careful maturity, once Susan had left us, our lonely anxieties
fastened upon this crying fact of her youth; it was
her youth, her inexperience, that made her venture suddenly
pathetic and dreadful to us, made us yearn to watch
over her, warn her of pitfalls, guide her steps.</p>

<p>True, she was not alone. Miss Goucher was admirable
in her way; though a middle-aged spinster, after all, unused<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
to the sharp temptations and fierce competitions of
metropolitan life. It was not a house-mother Susan would
need; the wolves lurked beyond the door&mdash;shrewd, soft-treading
wolves, cunningly disguised. How could a child,
a charming and too daring child&mdash;however gifted&mdash;be expected
to deal with these creatures? The thought of these
subtle, these patient ones, tracking her&mdash;tracking her&mdash;chilled
us to hours-long wakefulness in the night! Then
with the morning a letter would come, filled with strange
men's names.</p>

<p>We compared notes, consulted together&mdash;shaking unhappy
heads. We wrote tactful letters to Heywood Sampson,
begging him, but always indirectly, to keep an eye.
We ran down singly for nights in town, rescued&mdash;the verb
was ours&mdash;Susan and Miss Goucher from their West 10th
Street boarding-house, interfered with their work or other
plans, haled them&mdash;the verb, I fear, was theirs&mdash;to dinner,
to the opera or theater, or perhaps to call on someone of
ribbed respectability who might prove an observant friend.
God knows, in spite of all resolutions, we did our poor best
to mind Susan's business for her, to brood over her destiny
from afar!</p>

<p>And God knows our efforts were superfluous! The traps,
stratagems, springes in her path, merely suspected by us
and hence the more darkly dreaded, were clearly seen by
Susan and laughed at for the ancient, pitiful frauds they
were. The dull craft, the stale devices of avarice or lust
were no novelties to her; she greeted them, <i>en passant</i>,
with the old Birch Street terrier-look; just a half-mocking
nod of recognition&mdash;an amused, half-wistful salute to her
gamin past. It was her gamin past we had forgotten, Phil
and I, when we agonized over Susan's inexperienced youth.
Inexperienced? Bob Blake's kid! If there were things
New York could yet teach Bob Blake's kid&mdash;and there
were many&mdash;they were not those that had made her see in
it "Birch Street&mdash;on a slightly exaggerated scale"!</p>

<p>But, as the Greeks discovered many generations ago,
it is impossible to be high-minded or clear-sighted enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
to outwit a secret unreason in the total scheme of things.
Else the virtuous, in the Greek sense, would be always the
fortunate; and perhaps then would grow too self-regarding.
Does the last and austerest beauty of the ideal not flower
from this, that it can promise us nothing but itself! You
can choose a clear road, yet you shall never walk there in
safety: Chance&mdash;that secret unreason&mdash;lurks in the hedgerows,
myriad-formed, to plot against you. "<i>H&eacute;las!</i>" as
the French heroine might say. "Diddle-diddle-dumpling!"
as might say Susan.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Meaning: That strain, Ambo, was
of a higher mood, doubtless; but do return to your muttons.</p>

<p>Susan had reached New York late in November, 1913,
and the letter to Phil dates from the following January.
Barely two months had passed since her first calls upon
Maltby and Heywood Sampson, but every day of that
period had been made up of crowded hours. Of the three
manufactured-in-advance articles for the Garden Ex.,
Maltby had accepted one, paying thirty dollars for it, half-rate&mdash;Susan's
first professional earnings; but the manner
of his acceptance had convinced Susan it was a mere stroke
of personal diplomacy on his part. He did not wish to
encourage her as a business associate, for Maltby kept his
business activities rigidly separate from what he held to
be his life; neither did he wish to offend her. What he
wholly desired was to draw her into the immediate circles
he frequented as a social being, where he could act as her
patron on a scale at once more brilliant and more impressive.</p>

<p>So far as the Garden Ex. was concerned, his attitude
from the first had been one of sympathetic discouragement.
Susan hit off his manner perfectly in an earlier letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'My dear Susan! You can write very delicate, distinctive
verse, no doubt, and all that&mdash;and of course there's a
fairly active market for verse nowadays, and I can put you
in touch with some little magazines, <i>&agrave; c&ocirc;t&eacute;</i>, that print such
things, and even occasionally pay for them. They're your
field, I'm convinced. But, frankly, I can't see you quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
as one of our contributors&mdash;and I couldn't pay you a
higher compliment!</p>

<p>"'You don't suppose, do you, I sit here like an old-fashioned
editor, reading voluntary contributions? No,
my dear girl; I have a small, well-broken staff of writers,
and I tell them what to write. If I find myself, for example,
with a lot of parade interiors taken in expensive
homes, I select four or five, turn 'em over to Abramovitz,
and tell him to do us something on "The More Dignified
Dining-Room" or "The Period Salon, a Study in Restfulness."
Abramovitz knows exactly what to say, and how
to point the snobbish-but-not-too-snobbish captions and
feature the best names. I've no need to experiment, you
see. I count on Abramovitz. Just so with other matters.
Here's an article, now, on "The Flaunting Paeony."
Skeat did that, of course. It's signed "Winifred Snow"&mdash;all
his flower-and-sundial stuff is&mdash;and it couldn't be better!
I don't even have to read it.</p>

<p>"'Well, there you are! I'm simply a purveyor of standardized
goods in standardized packages. Dull work, but
it pays.'</p>

<p>"'Exactly!' I struck in. 'It pays! That's why I'm
interested. Sister and Togo and I need the money!'"</p></div>

<p>As for the brilliant, intertwined circles frequented by
Maltby as a social being, within which, he hoped to persuade
Susan, lay true freedom, while habit slyly bound her
with invisible chains&mdash;well, they are a little difficult to describe.
Taken generally, we may think of them as the
Artistic Smart Set. Maltby's acquaintance was wide, penetrating
in many directions; but he felt most at home among
those iridescent ones of earth whose money is as easy as
their morals, and whose ruling passion for amusement is at
least directed by &aelig;sthetic sensibilities and vivacious brains.</p>

<p>Within Maltby's intersecting circles were to be found,
then, many a piquant contrast, many an anomalous combination.
There the young, emancipated society matron, of
fattest purse and slenderest figure, expressed her sophisticated
paganism through interpretative dancing; and there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the fashionable painter of portraits, solidly arrived, exhibited
her slender figure on a daring canvas&mdash;made possible
by the fatness of her purse&mdash;at one of his peculiarly
intimate studio teas. There the reigning <i>ing&eacute;nue</i>, whose
graceful <i>diablerie</i> in imagined situations on the stage was
equalled only by her roguish effrontery in more real, if
hardly less public situations off, played up to the affluent
<i>amateur</i>&mdash;patron of all arts that require an unblushing co&ouml;peration
from pretty young women. There, in short, all
were welcome who liked the game and were not hampered
in playing it by dull inhibitions, material or immaterial.
It was Bohemia <i>de luxe</i>&mdash;Bohemia in the same sense that
Marie Antoinette's dairy-farm was Arcady.</p>

<p>That Susan&mdash;given her doting guardian, her furs, her
Chow, her shadowy-gleaming, imaginative charm, her sharp
audacities of speech&mdash;would bring a new and seductive
personality to this perpetual carnival was Maltby's dream;
she was predestined&mdash;he had long suspected the tug of
that fate upon her&mdash;to shine there by his side. He best
could offer the cup, and her gratitude for its heady drafts
of life would be merely his due. It was an exciting
prospect; it promised much; and it only remained to intoxicate
Susan with the wine of an unguessed freedom.
This, Maltby fondly assured himself, would prove no difficult
task. Life was life, youth was youth, joy was joy;
their natural affinities were all on his side and would play
into his practiced hands.</p>

<p>Doubtless Phil and I must have agreed with him&mdash;from
how differently anxious a spirit!&mdash;but all three of us would
then have proved quite wrong. To intoxicate Susan,
Maltby did find a difficult, in the end an impossible, task.
He took her&mdash;not unwilling to enter and appraise any circle
from high heaven to nether hell&mdash;to all the right, magical
places, exposed her to all the heady influences of his
world; and she found them enormously stimulating&mdash;to her
sense of the ironic. Maltby's sensuous, quick-witted friends
simply would not come true for Susan when she first moved
among them; they were not serious about anything but refined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
sensation and she could not take their refined sensations
seriously; but for a time they amused her, and she
relished them much as Charles Lamb relished the belles
and rakes of Restoration Drama: "They are a world of
themselves almost as much as fairyland."</p>

<p>To their intimate dinners, their intimate musical evenings,
their intimate studio revels&mdash;she came on occasion
with Maltby as to a play: "altogether a speculative scene of
things." She could, in those early weeks, have borrowed
Lamb's words for her own comedic detachment: "We are
amongst a chaotic people. We are not to judge them by
our usages. No reverend institutions are insulted by their
proceedings&mdash;for they have none among them. No peace
of families is violated&mdash;for no family ties exist among
them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No deep affections are disquieted, no holy-wedlock
bands are snapped asunder&mdash;for affection's depth and
wedded faith are not the growth of that soil. There is
neither right nor wrong.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Of what consequence is it to
Virtue or how is she at all concerned?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The whole thing
is a passing pageant."</p>

<p>It is probable that Maltby at first mistook her interest
in the spectacle for the preliminary stirrings of its spell
within her; but he must soon have been aware&mdash;for he had
intelligence&mdash;that Susan was not precisely flinging herself
among his maskers with the thrilled abandon that would
betoken surrender. She was not afraid of these clever,
beauty-loving maskers, some of whom bore celebrated
names; it was not timidity that restrained her; she, too,
loved beauty and lilting wit and could feel joyously at
ease among them&mdash;for an hour or two&mdash;once in a while.
But to remain permanently within those twining circles,
held to a limited dream, when she was conscious of wilder,
freer, more adventurous spaces without&mdash;&mdash;! Why should
she narrow her sympathies like that? It never occurred
to her as a temptation to do so. She had drunk of a
headier cup, and had known a vaster intoxication. From
the magic circle of her cedar trees, in that lonely abandoned
field back of Mount Carmel, the imagination of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
heart had long since streamed outward beyond all such
passing pageants, questing after a dream that does not
pass.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>No gilded nutshell could bound her now; she could become
the slave of no <i>intersected</i> ring.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lesser incantations
were powerless.</p>

<p>So much, then, for my own broad annotation of Susan's
letter to Phil! But I leave you with generalizations, when
your interest is in concrete fact. Patience. In my too
fumbling way I am ready for you there, as well.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">Susan To Jimmy</span></div>

<p>"I suppose you'd really like to know what I've lately
been up to; but I hardly know myself. It's absurd, of
course, but I almost think I'm having a weeny little fit of
the blues to-night&mdash;not dark-blue devils exactly&mdash;say, light-blue
gnomes! I hate being pushed about, and things have
pushed me about, rather. It's that, I think. There's been
too much&mdash;of everything&mdash;somehow&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You see, my social life just now is divided into three
parts, like all Gaul, and as my business opportunities&mdash;Midas
forgive them!&mdash;have all come out of my social contacts,
I'll have to begin with them. Maltby's the golden
key to the first part; Mr. Heywood Sampson, the great old-school
publisher and editor-author, is the iron key to the
second; and chance&mdash;our settling down here on the fringes
of Greenwich Village&mdash;is the skeleton key to the third.</p>

<p>"I seem to be getting all Gaul mixed up with Bluebeard's
closets and things, but I'll try to straighten my
kinky metaphors out for you, Jimmy, if it takes me all
night. But I assume you're more or less up to date on
me, since I find you all most brazenly hand me round, and
since I wrote Phil&mdash;and got severely scolded in return;
deserved it, too&mdash;all about Maltby's patiently snubbing me
as a starving author and impatiently rushing me as a possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
member for his Emancipated Order of &AElig;sthetic May-Flies&mdash;I
call it his, for he certainly thinks of it that way.
Now&mdash;Maltby and I have not precisely quarreled, but the
north wind doth blow and we've already had snow enough
to cool his enthusiasm. The whole thing's unpleasant; but
I've learned something. Result&mdash;my occasional flutterings
among the &AElig;sthetic May-Flies grow beautifully less.
They'd cease altogether if I hadn't made friends&mdash;to call
them that&mdash;with a May-Fly or two.</p>

<p>"One of them's the novelist, Clifton Young, a May-Fly
at heart&mdash;but there's a strain of Honeybee in his blood
somewhere. It's an unhappy combination&mdash;all the talents
and few of the virtues; but I like him in spite of himself.
For one thing, he doesn't pose; and he can <i>write!</i> He's a
lost soul, though&mdash;thinks life is a tragic farce. Almost all
the May-Flies try to think that; it's a sort of guaranty of
the last sophistication; but it's genuine with Clifton, he
must have been born thinking it. He doesn't ask for
sympathy, either; if he did, I couldn't pity him&mdash;and get
jeered at wittily for my pains!</p>

<p>"Then there's Mona Leslie, who might have been a true
Honeybee if everybody belonging to her hadn't died too
soon, leaving her hopeless numbers of millions. Mona, for
some reason, has taken a passing fancy to me; all her fancies
pass. She sings like an angel, and might have made
a career&mdash;if it had seemed worth while. It never has.
Nothing has, but vivid sensation&mdash;from ascetic religion to
sloppy love; and, at thirty, she's exhausted the whole show.
So she spends her time now in a mad duel with boredom.
Poor woman! Luckily the fairies gave her a selfishly kind
heart, and there's a piece of it left, I think. It may even
win the duel for her in the end. More and more she's the
reckless patron of all the arts, almost smothering ennui
under her benefactions. She'd smother poor me, too, if I'd
let her; but I can't; I'm either not brazen enough or not
Christian enough to let her patronize me for her own
amusement. And that's her one new sensation for the last
three years!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Still, I've one thing to thank her for, and I wish I
could feel grateful. She introduced me, at one of her
Arabian-Nightish <i>soir&eacute;es musicales</i>, to Hadow Bury, proprietor
of <i>Whim</i>, the smarty-party weekly review. In two
years it's made a sky-rocketing success, by printing the
harum-scarumest possible comment on all the social and
&aelig;sthetic fads and freaks of the day&mdash;just the iris froth
of the wave, that and that only. Hadow's a big, black,
bleak man-mountain. You'd take him for an undertaker
by special appointment to coal-beef-and-iron kings. You'd
never suspect him of having capitalized the Frivolous.
But he's found it means bagfuls of reelers for him, so he
takes it seriously. He's after the <i>goods</i>. He gets and delivers
the goods, no matter what they cost. He's ready to
pay any price now for a new brand of cerebral champagne.</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't know <i>what</i> he was when Mona casually
dropped me beside him, but he loomed so big and black
and bleak he frightened me&mdash;till my thoughts chattered!
I rattled on&mdash;like this, Jimmy&mdash;only not because I wanted
to, but because having madly started I didn't know how
to stop. I made a fool of myself&mdash;utter; with the result
that he detected a slightly different flavor in my folly, a
possibly novel <i>bouquet</i>&mdash;let's call it the 'Birch Street <i>bouquet</i>.'
At any rate, he finally silenced me to ask whether
I could write as I talked, and I said I hoped not; and he
looked bleaker and blacker than ever and said that was the
worst of it, so few amusing young women could! It seemed
to be one of the more annoying laws of Nature.</p>

<p>"The upshot was, I found out all about him and his
ambitions for <i>Whim;</i> and the fantastic upshot of <i>that</i> was,
I'm now doing a nonsense column a week for him&mdash;have
been for the past five&mdash;and getting fifty dollars a week for
my nonsense, too! I sign the thing "Dax"&mdash;a signature
invented by shutting both eyes and punching at my typewriter
three times, just to see what would happen. "Dax"
happened, and I'm to be allowed to burble on as him&mdash;I
think Dax is a him&mdash;for ten weeks; then, if my stuff goes,
catches on, gets over&mdash;I'm to have a year's contract. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
farewell to double-room-and-alcove for aye! Else, farewell
<i>Whim!</i> So it <i>must</i> get over&mdash;I'm determined! I stick
at nothing. I even test my burble on poor Sister every
week before sending it in. If she smiles sadly, twice, I
seal up the envelope and breathe again.</p>

<p>"That's my bird in the hand, Jimmy&mdash;a sort of crazily
screaming jay&mdash;but I mustn't let it escape.</p>

<p>"There's another bird, though. A real bluebird, still
in the bush&mdash;and oh, so shy! And he lures me into the
second and beautifulest part of all Gaul&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's no use, I'm dished! Sister says no one ever wrote
or read such a monstrous letter, and commands me to stop
now and go to bed. There's a look in her eye&mdash;she means
it. Good-night and good luck&mdash;I'll tell you about my other
two parts of Gaul as soon as I can, unless you wire me&mdash;collect&mdash;'Cut
it out!' Or unless you run down&mdash;you never
have&mdash;and learn of them that way. Why not&mdash;<i>soon?</i>"</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Jimmy Kane took the hint, or obeyed the open request,
in Susan's letter and went down to New York for the week-end;
and on the following Monday Miss Goucher wrote her
first considerable letter to me. It was a long letter, for her,
written&mdash;recopied, I fancy&mdash;in precise script, though it
would have been a mere note for Susan.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>My dear Mr. Hunt:</i> I promised to let you know from
time to time the exact truth about our experiment. It is
already a success financially. Susan is now earning from
sixty to seventy dollars a week, with every prospect of
earning substantially more in the near future. Her satirical
paragraphs and verses in "Whim" are quoted and
copied everywhere. They do not seem to me quite the
Susan I love, but then, I am not a clever person; and it is
undeniable that "Who is Dax?" is being asked now on
every hand. If this interest continues, I am assured it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
can only mean fame and fortune. I am very proud of
Susan, as you must be.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Hunt, there is another side to my picture. In
alluding to it I feel a sense of guilt toward Susan; I know
she would not wish me to do so. Yet I feel that I must. If
I may say so to you, Susan has quickened in me many
starved affections, and they all center in her. In this, may
I not feel without offense that we are of one mind?</p>

<p>If I had Susan's pen I could tell you more clearly why I
am troubled. I lack her gift, which is also yours, of expressing
what I feel is going on secretly in another's mind.
Mr. Phar and a Mr. Young, a writer, have been giving
Susan some cause for annoyance lately; but that is not it.
Mr. Hunt, she is deeply unhappy. She would deny it,
even to you or me; but it is true.</p>

<p>My mind is too commonplace for this task. If my attempt
to explain sounds crude, please forgive it and supply
what is beyond me.</p>

<p>I can only say now that when I once told you Susan
could stand alone, I was mistaken. In a sense she can. If
her health does not give way, life will never beat her down.
But&mdash;there are the needs of women, older than art. They
tear at us, Mr. Hunt; at least while we are young. I could
not say this to you, but I must manage somehow to write
it. I do not refer to passion, taken by itself. I am old
enough to be shocked, Mr. Hunt, to find that many brilliant
women to-day have advanced beyond certain boundaries so
long established. You will understand.</p>

<p>A woman's need is greater than passion, greater even
than motherhood. It is so hard for me to express it. But
she can only find rest when these things are not lived separately;
when, with many other elements, they build up a
living whole&mdash;what we call a <i>home</i>. How badly I put it;
for I feel so much more than the conventional sentiments.
Will you understand me at all if I say that Susan is homesick&mdash;for
a home she has never known and may never be
privileged to know? With all her insight I think she
doesn't realize this yet; but I once suffered acutely in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
way, and it perhaps gives me the right to speak. Of course
I may be quite wrong. I am more often wrong than right.</p>

<p>I venture to inclose a copy of some lines, rescued last
week from our scrap-basket. I'm not a critic, but am I
wrong in thinking it would have been a pity to burn them?
As they are not in free verse, which I do not appreciate as
I should, they affected me very much; and I feel they will
tell you, far more than my letter, why I am a little worried
about Susan.</p>

<p>Young Mr. Kane informed me, when he was here on
Sunday, that you and Professor Farmer are well. He
seems a nice boy, though still a little crude perhaps; nothing
offensive. I am confined to the room to-day by a
slight cold of no consequence; I hope I may not pass it
on to Susan. Kindly give my love to Sonia, if you should
see her, and to little Ivan. I trust the new housekeeper
I obtained for you is reasonably efficient, and that Tumps
is not proving too great a burden. I am,</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">Respectfully yours,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Malvina Goucher</span>.<br />
</div></div>

<p>The inclosed "copy of some lines" affected me quite as
much as they had Miss Goucher, and it was inconceivable
to me that Susan, having written them, could have tossed
them away. As a matter of fact she had not. Like Calais
in the queen's heart, they were engraven in her own. They
were too deeply hers; she had meant merely to hide them
from the world; and it is even now with a curious reluctance
that I give them to you here. The lines bore no
title, but I have ventured, with Susan's consent, to call
them</p>

<h2>THE FIFTH CHAPTER</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<div class='cap'>I &nbsp; AM an essayist, if anything, trying to tell Susan's story,
and telling it badly, I fear, for lack of narrative skill.
So it is with no desire to prolong cheaply a possible point
of suspense that I must double back now before I can go
forward. My personal interest centers so entirely in Susan
herself, in the special qualities of her mind and heart, that
I have failed to bring in certain stiff facts&mdash;essential, alas,
to all further progress. A practiced novelist, handling this
purely biographic material&mdash;such a man as Clifton Young&mdash;would
quietly have "planted" these facts in their due
order, thus escaping my present embarrassment. But indeed
I am approaching a cruel crisis in Susan's life and
in the lives of those dearest to her; a period of sheer circumstantial
fatality; one of those incursions of mad coincidence,
of crass melodrama, which&mdash;with a brutal, ironic,
improbability, as if stage-managed by an anarchistic fiend
of the pit&mdash;bursts through some fine-spun, geometrical web
of days, leaving chaos behind; and I am ill-equipped to
deal with this chance destruction, this haphazard wantonness.</div>

<p>Even could I merely have observed it from the outside,
with &aelig;sthetic detachment, it would baffle me now; I should
find it too crude for art, too arbitrary. It is not in my line.
But God knows the victim of what seems an insane break
in Nature is in no mood for art; he can do little more
than cry out or foolishly rail!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Jimmy returned from his excursion to New York on the
Sunday evening preceding Miss Goucher's letter. She must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
have been at work on it the next evening when Phil brought
him to dine with me. It was our deliberate purpose to
draw him out, track his shy impressions of Susan and of
her new life in her new world. But it was hard going at
first; for ten minutes or so we bagged little but the ordinary
Jimmyesque <i>clich&eacute;s</i>. He had had a great time, <i>etc.</i>,
<i>etc.</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Matters improved with the roast. It then appeared that
he had lightly explored with Susan the two-thirds of Gaul
omitted from her letter. He had called with her on Heywood
Sampson, and fathomed Susan's allusion to the shy
bluebird. Mr. Sampson, he assured us, was a fine old boy&mdash;strong
for Susan too! He'd read a lot of her poems
and things and was going to bring out the poems for her
right away. But the bluebird in the bush had to do with
a pet scheme of his for a weekly critical review of a different
stamp from Hadow Bury's <i>Whim</i>. Solider, Jimmy imagined;
safe and sane&mdash;the real thing! If Mr. Sampson
should decide to launch it&mdash;he was still hesitating over the
business outlook&mdash;Susan was to find a place on his staff.</p>

<p>Mr. Sampson, Jimmy opined, had the right idea about
things in general. He didn't like Susan's quick stuff in
<i>Whim;</i> thought it would cheapen her if she kept at it too
long. And Mr. Sampson didn't approve of Susan's remaining
third of Gaul, either&mdash;her Greenwich Village
friends. Not much wonder, Jimmy added; Susan had
trotted him round to three or four studios and places, and
they were a funny job lot. Too many foreigners among
them for him; they talked too much; and they pawed. But
some nice young people, too. Most of them were young&mdash;and
not stuck up. Friendly. Sort of alive&mdash;interested in
everything&mdash;except, maybe, being respectable. Their jokes,
come to think of it, were all about being respectable&mdash;kidding
everyday people who weren't up to the latest ideas.
There was a lot of jabber one place about the "&OElig;dipus
Complex," for example, but he didn't connect at all. He
had his own idea&mdash;surely, not of the latest&mdash;that a lot
of the villagers might feel differently when they began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
make good and started their bank accounts. But Susan
was on to them, anyway, far more than they were on to
her! She liked them, though&mdash;in spite of Mr. Sampson;
didn't fall for their craziest ways or notions of course,
but was keen about their happy-go-lucky side&mdash;their pep!
Besides, they weren't all alike, naturally. Take the pick
of them, the ones that did things instead of posing round
and dressing the part, and Jimmy could see they might be
there. At least, they were on their way&mdash;like Susan.</p>

<p>This was all very well, so far as it went; but we had
felt, Phil and I, a dumb undercurrent struggling to press
upward into speech, and after dinner before the fire, we
did our best to help Jimmy free its course. Gradually it
became apparent; it rather trickled than gushed forth.
Jimmy was bothered, more than bothered; there was something,
perhaps there were several things, on his mind. We
did not press him, using subtler methods, biding our time;
and little by little Jimmy oozed toward the full revelation
of an uneasy spirit.</p>

<p>"Did you see Mr. Phar?" Phil asked.</p>

<p>"No," said Jimmy, his forehead knotting darkly; "I
guess it's a good thing I didn't too!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, that letter I had from Susan&mdash;the one I showed
you, Mr. Hunt&mdash;mentioned some unpleasantness with Mr.
Phar; and all Saturday afternoon while she was trotting
me round, I could see she'd been worrying to herself a
good deal."</p>

<p>"Worrying?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Whenever she thought I wasn't paying attention
her face would go&mdash;sort of dead tired and sad&mdash;all used
up. I can't describe it. And one or two remarks she
dropped didn't sound as happy as she meant them to.
Then, Sunday morning, she had to get some work done, so
I took Miss Goucher to church. I'm supposed to be a
Catholic, you know; but I guess I'm not much of anything.
I'd just as soon go to one kind of church as another,
if the music's good. Anyway, it was a nice morning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and Miss Goucher thought I'd like to see the Fifth Avenue
parade; so we walked up to some silk-stocking church
above Thirty-fourth Street, where they have a dandy choir;
and back again afterwards. I stayed at the Brevoort, down
near them, you know; and Miss Goucher certainly is a
peach. We got along fine. And I found out from her
how Mr. Phar's been acting. He's a bad actor, all right.
I'm just as glad I didn't run into him. I might have done
something foolish."</p>

<p>"What, for instance?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"Well," muttered Jimmy, "there's some things I can't
stand. I might have punched his head."</p>

<p>Phil whistled softly.</p>

<p>"He's not what I call a white man," explained Jimmy,
dogged and slow, as if to justify his vision of assault.
"He's a painted pup."</p>

<p>"Come, Jimmy!" Phil commanded. "Out with it!
Hunt and I know he's been annoying Susan, but that's all
we know. I supposed he might have been pressing his attentions
too publicly. If it's more than that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was an unusual sternness in Phil's eye. Jimmy
appealed from it to mine, but in vain.</p>

<p>"Look here, Mr. Hunt," he blurted, "Susan's all right,
of course&mdash;and so's Miss Goucher! They've got their eyes
open. And maybe it's not up to me to say anything. But
if I was in your place, I'd feel like giving two or three
people down there a piece of my mind! Susan wouldn't
thank me for saying so, I guess; she's modern&mdash;she likes
to be let alone. Why, she laughed at me more than once
for getting sort of hot! And I know I've a bunch to learn
yet. But all the same," he pounded on, "I do know this:
It was a dirty trick of Mr. Phar's not to stand up for
Susan!"</p>

<p>"Not stand up for her! What do you mean?" Phil
almost barked.</p>

<p>"Jimmy means, Phil," I explained, "that some rather
vague rumors began not along ago to spread through
Maltby's crowd in regard to Susan&mdash;as to why she found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
it advisable to leave New Haven. Many of his friends
know me, of course&mdash;or know Gertrude; know all about
us, at any rate. It's not very remarkable, then, that
Susan's appearance in New York&mdash;and so far as Maltby's
May-Flies know, in some sense under his wing&mdash;has set
tongues wagging. I was afraid of it; but I know Maltby's
set well enough to know that to-day's rumor, unless it's
pretty sharply spiced, is soon forgotten. To-morrow's is
so much fresher, you see. The best thing for innocent
victims to do is to keep very still. And then, I confess, it
seemed to me unlikely that Maltby would permit anything
of the sort to go too far."</p>

<p>I saw that Jimmy was following my exposition with the
most painful surprise. Phil grunted disgustedly as I
ended.</p>

<p>"I don't pretend to much knowledge of that world," he
said deliberately, "but common sense tells me Maltby
Phar might think it to his advantage to fan the flame instead
of stamping it out. I may be unfair to him, but I'm
even capable of supposing he touched it off in the first
place."</p>

<p>"No, Phil," I objected, "he wouldn't have done that.
But you seem to be right about his failing to stamp out
the sparks. That's what you meant by his not standing
up for Susan, isn't it, Jimmy?"</p>

<p>The boy's face was a study in unhappy perplexity. "I
guess I'm like Professor Farmer!" he exclaimed. "I'm
not on to people who act like that. But, Mr. Hunt, you're
dead wrong&mdash;excuse me, sir!"</p>

<p>"Go on, Jimmy."</p>

<p>"Well, I mean&mdash;you spoke of vague rumors, didn't you?
They're not vague. I guess Susan hasn't wanted to upset
you. Miss Goucher told me all about it, and she wouldn't
have done it, would she, if she hadn't hoped I'd bring it
straight back to you? I guess she promised Susan not to
tell you, so she told me. That's the only way I can figure
it," concluded Jimmy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Phil was grim now. "Give us your facts, Jimmy&mdash;all of
them."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. There's a Mr. Young; he writes things. He's
clever. They're all clever down there. Well, Mr. Young's
dead gone on Susan; but then, he's the kind that's always
dead gone on somebody. It's women with him, you see,
sir. Susan understands. It don't seem right she should,
somehow; but&mdash;well, Susan's always been different from
most girls. At least, I don't know many girls&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind that," prompted Phil.</p>

<p>"No, sir. Talking about things like this always rattles
me. I can't help it. They kind of stick in my throat.
Well, Mr. Young don't want to marry anybody, but he's
been making love to Susan&mdash;trying to. He had the wrong
idea about her, you see; and Susan saw that, too&mdash;saw he
thought she was playing him for a poor fish. So&mdash;her way&mdash;out
she comes with it to him, flat. And he gets sore
and comes back at her with what he'd heard." Jimmy's
handkerchief was pulled out at this point; he mopped his
brow. "It don't feel right even to speak of lies like this
about&mdash;any decent girl," he mumbled.</p>

<p>"No," Phil agreed, "it doesn't. But there's nothing
for it now. Get it said and done with!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Mr. Young told Susan he wasn't a fool; he
knew she'd been&mdash;what she shouldn't be&mdash;up here."</p>

<p>"Hunt's mistress, you mean?" snapped Phil.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," whispered Jimmy, his face purple with agonized
shame.</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Susan's a wonder," continued Jimmy, taking heart
now his Rubicon lay behind him. "Most girls would have
thrown a fit. But Susan seems to feel there's a lot to Mr.
Young, in spite of all that rotten side of him. She saw
right away he believed that about her, and so he couldn't
be blamed much for getting sore. Anyway, he must have
a white streak in him, for Susan talked to him&mdash;the way
she can&mdash;and he soon realized he was in all wrong. But
the <i>reason</i> he was in wrong&mdash;that's what finished things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
between Susan and Mr. Phar! I guess you won't blame
me for wanting to punch his head."</p>

<p>"No," I threw in; "I shouldn't blame you for wanting
to punch mine!"</p>

<p>"Give us the reason, Jimmy," insisted Phil, his grave,
Indianlike face stiffened to a mask.</p>

<p>"Mr. Young didn't get that lie from Mr. Phar," admitted
Jimmy, "but he did take it straight to him, when
he first heard it, thinking he ought to know."</p>

<p>"Good God!" I cried. "Do you mean to tell me Maltby
confirmed it?"</p>

<p>"Well," Jimmy hesitated, "it seems he didn't come right
out and say, 'Yes, that's so!' But he didn't deny it either.
Sort of shrugged his shoulders, I guess, and did things
with his eyebrows. Whatever he did or didn't, Mr. Young
got it fastened in his head then and there that Susan&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But this time Jimmy simply couldn't go on; the words
stuck in his throat and stayed there.</p>

<p>Phil's eyes met mine and held them, long.</p>

<p>"Hunt," he said quietly at last, "it's a fortunate thing
for Susan&mdash;for all of us&mdash;that I have long years of self-discipline
behind me. Otherwise, I should go to New York
to-morrow, find Maltby Phar, and shoot him."</p>

<p>Jimmy's blue eyes flashed toward Phil a startled but
admiring glance.</p>

<p>"What do <i>you</i> propose to do, Hunt?" demanded Phil.</p>

<p>"Think," I replied; "think hard&mdash;think things through.
Wednesday morning I shall leave for New York."</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>My prophecy was correct. Wednesday, at 12.03 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, I
left for New York, in response to the shocking telegram
from Lucette. I arrived at Gertrude's address, an august
apartment house on upper Park Avenue, a little before
half-past two, dismissed my taxi at the door, noting as I
did so a second taxi standing at the curb just ahead of
my own, and was admitted to the dignified public entrance-hall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
with surprising promptness, considering the hour, by
the mature buttons on duty. Buttons was a man nearing
sixty, at a guess, of markedly Irish traits, and he was unexpectedly
wide-awake. When I gave him my name, and
briefly stated the reason for my untimely arrival, his deep-set
eyes glittered with excited curiosity, while he drew
down deep parallels about his mouth in a grimacing attempt
at deepest sympathy and profoundest respect. I
questioned him. Several persons had gone up to Mrs.
Hunt's apartment, he solemnly informed me, during the
past two hours. He believed the police were in charge.</p>

<p>"Police?" I exclaimed, incredulous.</p>

<p>He believed so. He would say no more.</p>

<p>"Take me up at once!" I snapped at him. "Surely
there's a mistake. There can be no reason for police interference."</p>

<p>His eyes glittered more shrewdly, the drawn parallels
deepened yet further as he shot back the elevator door.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>It was unmistakably a police officer who admitted me
for the first and last time to Gertrude's apartment. On
hearing my name he nodded, then closed the door firmly
in the face of Buttons, who had lingered.</p>

<p>"He's been warned not to tip off the press," said the
police officer, "but it's just as well to be cautious."</p>

<p>"The press? What do you mean?" I asked, still incredulous.
"Is it a New York custom for police to enter a
house of mourning?" I was aware as I spoke of repressed
voices murmuring in an adjoining room.</p>

<p>"I'm Sergeant Conlon," he answered, "in charge here
till the coroner comes. He should make it by seven. If
you're the poor lady's husband, you'll be needed. I'll
have to detain you."</p>

<p>As he ended, the murmur ended in the adjoining room,
and Lucette walked out from it. She was wearing an
evening gown&mdash;blue, I think&mdash;cut very low, and a twinkling
ornament of some kind in her hair. She has fine
shoulders and beautiful hair. But her face had gone haggard;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
she had been weeping; she looked ten years older
than when I had last seen her.</p>

<p>"What is it? What is it?" I demanded of her. "I
know nothing but your telegram!"</p>

<p>"Looks like murder," said Sergeant Conlon, dry and
short. "I wouldn't talk much if I was you, not till the
coroner gets here. I'm bound to make notes of what you
say."</p>

<p>For the merest hundredth of a second my scalp prickled,
my flesh went cold; but sheer incredulity was still strong
upon me; it beat back the horror. It was simply not real,
all this.</p>

<p>"At least," I managed, "give me facts&mdash;something!"</p>

<p>Then unreality deepened to utter nightmare, passing all
bounds of reason. Lucette spoke, and life turned for me
to sheer prattling madness; to a gibbering grotesque!</p>

<p>"<i>Susan</i> did it!" she cried, her voice going high and strident,
slipping from all control. "I know it! I know she
did! I know it! Wasn't she with her? <i>Alone</i> with her?
Who else could have done it! Who else! <i>It's in her
blood!</i>"</p>

<p>Well, of course, when a woman you have played tag
with in her girlhood goes mad before you, raves&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>How could one act or answer? Then, too, she had vanished;
or had I really seen her in the flesh at all? Really
heard her voice, crying out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Sergeant Conlon's voice came next; short, dry, businesslike.
It compelled belief.</p>

<p>"I've a question or two for you, Mr. Hunt. This way;
steady!"</p>

<p>I felt his hand under my elbow.</p>

<p>Gertrude's apartment was evidently a very large one;
I had vaguely the sensation of passing down a long hall
with an ell in it, and so into a small, simply furnished, but
tasteful room&mdash;the sitting-room for her maids, as I later
decided. Sergeant Conlon shut the door and locked it.</p>

<p>"That's not to keep you in," he said; "it's to keep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
others out. Sit down, Mr. Hunt. Smoke somethin'. Let's
make ourselves comfortable."</p>

<p>The click of the shot bolt in the lock had suddenly, I
found, restored my power of co&ouml;rdination. It had been
like the sharp handclap which brings home a hypnotized
subject to reason and reality. I was now, in a moment,
not merely myself again, but peculiarly alert and steady of
nerve, and I gave matter-of-fact assent to Sergeant Conlon's
suggestions. I lit a cigarette and took possession of
the most comfortable chair. Conlon remained standing.
He had refused my cigarettes, but he now lighted a long,
roughly rolled cigar.</p>

<p>"I get these from a fellow over on First Avenue," he
explained affably. "He makes them up himself. They're
not so bad."</p>

<p>I attempted a smile and achieved a classic reaction.
"They look&mdash;efficient," I said. "And now, sergeant, what
has happened here? If I've seemed dazed for the past ten
minutes, it's little wonder. I hurried down in response to a
telegram saying my wife.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You know we've lived apart
for years?" He grunted assent.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "Saying she had died
suddenly. And I walk in, unprepared, on people who
seem to me to be acting parts in a crook melodrama of the
crudest type. Be kind enough to tell me what it's all
about!"</p>

<p>Sergeant Conlon's gray-blue eyes fixed me as I spoke.
He was a big, thickset man, nearing middle age; the bruiser
build, physically; but with a solidly intelligent-looking
head and trustworthy eyes.</p>

<p>"I'll do that, Mr. Hunt," he assented. "I got Mrs.
Arthur to send you that telegram; but I'll say to you first-off,
now you've come, I don't suspect you of bein' mixed
up in this affair. When I shot that 'It looks like murder'
at you, I did it deliberate. Well&mdash;that's neither here nor
there; but I always go by the way things strike me. I
have to." He twirled a light chair round to face me and
seated himself, leaning a little forward, his great stubby
hands propped on his square knees. "Here's the facts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
then&mdash;what we know are facts: It seems, Mrs. Arthur&mdash;she's
been visitin' Mrs. Hunt for two weeks past&mdash;she went
to the opera to-night with a Mr. Phar; she says you know
him well." I nodded. "Durin' the last act of the opera
they were located by somebody in the office down there and
called out to the 'phone&mdash;an accident to Mrs. Hunt&mdash;see?&mdash;important."
Again I nodded. "Mrs. Arthur answered
the 'phone, and Doctor Askew&mdash;he lives in this house, but
he's Mrs. Hunt's reg'lar doctor&mdash;well, he was on the wire.
He just told her to hurry back as fast as she could&mdash;and
she and Mr. Phar hopped a taxi and beat it up here. Doctor
Askew met them at the door, and a couple of scared
maids. The doc's a good man&mdash;big rep&mdash;one of the best.
He'd taken charge and sent on the quiet for us. I got
here with a couple of my men soon after Mrs. Arthur&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, <i>I</i> know!" he stopped me off. "But I want
you to get it all straight. Mrs. Hunt, sir, was killed&mdash;somehow&mdash;with
a long, sharp-pointed brass paper-knife&mdash;a
reg'lar weapon. I've examined it. And someone drove
that thing&mdash;and it must'a' took some force, believe <i>me!</i>&mdash;right
through her left eye up to the handle&mdash;a full inch
of metal plumb into her brain!"</p>

<p>I tried to believe him as he said this; as, seeing my blankness,
he repeated it for me in other words. For the
moment it was impossible. This sort of thing must have
happened in the world, of course&mdash;at other times, to
other people. But not now, not to Gertrude. Certainly
not to Gertrude; a woman so aloof, so exquisite, self-sheltered,
class-sheltered, not merely from ugliness, from
the harsh and brutal, but from everything in life even verging
toward vulgarity, coarse passion, the unrestrained.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"That's the way she was killed, Mr. Hunt&mdash;no mistake.
Now&mdash;who did it&mdash;and why? That's the point."</p>

<p>At my elbow was a table with a reading-lamp on it,
a desk-set, a work-basket, belonging, I suppose, to one of
the maids, and some magazines. One magazine lay just
before me&mdash;<i>The Reel World</i>&mdash;a by-product of the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
moving-picture industry. I had been staring&mdash;unseeingly,
at first&mdash;at a flamboyant advertisement on its cover that
clamored for my attention, until now, with Conlon's question,
it momentarily gained it. The release of a magnificent
Superfeature was announced&mdash;in no quavering terms.
"The Sins of the Fathers" it shrieked at me! "All the
thrilling human suspense"; "virile, compelling"; "brimming
over with the kind of action and adventure your
audiences crave"; "it delivers the wallop!"</p>

<p>Instantly, with a new force, Lucette's outcry swept back
upon me. "Susan did it! Wasn't she with her? Alone
with her? <i>It's in her blood!</i>"</p>

<p>And at once every faculty of my spirit leaped, with an
almost supernatural acuteness, to the defense of the one
being on earth I wholly loved. All sense of unreality vanished.
Now for it&mdash;since it must be so! Susan and I, if
need be, against the world!</p>

<p>"Go on, sergeant. What's your theory?"</p>

<p>"Never mind my theory! I'd like to get <i>yours</i> first&mdash;when
I've given you all I know."</p>

<p>"All right, then! But be quick about it!"</p>

<p>"Easy, Mr. Hunt! It's not as simple as all that. Well,
here it is: Somewhere round ten o'clock, a Miss Blake&mdash;a
magazine-writer livin' on West 10th Street&mdash;your ward,
I understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, she calls here, alone, and asks for Mrs. Arthur.
Mrs. Hunt's personal maid&mdash;English; she's no chicken
either&mdash;she lets her in and says Mrs. Arthur isn't here&mdash;see&mdash;and
didn't the door boy tell her so? Yes, says Miss
Blake, but she'll wait for her anyway. The maid&mdash;name
of Iffley&mdash;says she thought that was queer, so she put it to
Miss Blake that maybe she'd better ask Mrs. Hunt. Oh,
says Miss Blake, I thought she was out, too. But it seems
Mrs. Hunt was in her private sittin' room; she'd had a
slight bilious attack, and she'd got her corsets off and somethin'
loose on, the way women do, and was all set for a
good read. So the maid didn't think she could see Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Blake, but anyhow she took in her card&mdash;and Mrs. Hunt
decided to see her. That maid Iffley's an intelligent
woman; she's all broke up, but she ain't hysterical like the
cook&mdash;who didn't see nothin' anyway. The parlor maid
was havin' her night off, but she's back now, too, and
I've got 'em all safe where they can't talk to outsiders,
yet. I don't want this thing in the papers to-morrow,
not if I can help it; I want to keep it dark till I know
better where I'm gettin' off."</p>

<p>"Right!" I approved. "What's the maid's story?"</p>

<p>"Well, I've questioned her pretty close, and I think
it's to be relied on. It hits me that way. Mrs. Hunt, she
says, when she took in Miss Blake's card, was lyin' on her
couch in a long trailin' thing&mdash;what ladies call a negligee."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"And she was cuttin' the pages of some new book with
that paper-knife I spoke of."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"And her dog, a runty little French bull, was sleepin'
on the rug beside the couch."</p>

<p>"What does that matter?"</p>

<p>"More'n you'd think! He's got a broken leg&mdash;provin'
some kind of a struggle must'a'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see. Go on!"</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Hunt, the maid says, looked at Miss Blake's
card a minute and didn't say anythin' special, but seemed
kind of puzzled. Her only words was, 'Yes, I ought to see
her.' So the maid goes for Miss Blake and shows her to
the door, which she'd left ajar, and taps on it for her,
and Mrs. Hunt calls to come in. So Miss Blake goes in and
shuts the door after her, and the maid comes back to this
room we're in now&mdash;it's round the corner of the hall from
Mrs. Hunt's room&mdash;see? But she don't much more than
get here&mdash;just to the door&mdash;when she hears the dog give a
screech and then go on cryin' like as if he'd been hurt.
The cook was in here, too, and she claims she heard a kind
of jarrin' sound, like somethin' heavy fallin'; but Iffley&mdash;that's
the maid, they call her Iffley&mdash;says all she noticed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
was the dog. Anyway she listened a second, then she
started for Mrs. Hunt's room&mdash;and the cook, bein' nervous,
locked herself in here and sat with her eyes tight shut and
her fingers in her ears. Fact. She says she can't bear
nothin' disagreeable. Too bad about her, ain't it!"</p>

<p>"And then?" I protested, crossly.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Hunt, when the Iffley woman turned the
hall corner&mdash;the door of your poor wife's room opens, and
Miss Blake walks out. She had the paper-knife in her right
hand, and the knife and her hand was all bloody; her left
hand was bloody too; and we've found blood on her clothes
since. There was a queer, vacant look about her&mdash;that's
what the maid says. She didn't seem to see anythin'.
Naturally, the maid was scared stiff&mdash;but she got one look
in at the door anyway&mdash;that was enough for her. She was
too scared even to yell, she says. Paralyzed&mdash;she just
flopped back against the wall half faintin'.</p>

<p>"And then she noticed somethin' that kind of brought
her to again! Mr. Hunt, that young woman, Miss Blake&mdash;she'd
gone quiet as you please and curled herself down on
a rug in the hallway&mdash;that bloody knife in her hand&mdash;and
she was either dead or fast asleep! And then the doorbell
rang, and the Iffley woman says she don't know how she got
past that prostrate figger on the rug&mdash;her very words,
Mr. Hunt&mdash;that prostrate figger on the rug&mdash;but she did,
somehow; got to the door. And when she opened it, there
was Doctor Askew and the elevator man. And then she
passed out. And I must say I don't much blame her,
considerin'."</p>

<p>"Where's Miss Blake now?" I sharply demanded.</p>

<p>"She's still fast asleep, Mr. Hunt&mdash;to call it that. The
doc says it's&mdash;somethin' or other&mdash;due to shock. Same
as a trance."</p>

<p>I started up. "Where is Doctor Askew? I must see
him at once!"</p>

<p>"We've laid Miss Blake on the bed in Mrs. Arthur's
room. He's observin' her."</p>

<p>"Take me there."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll do that, Mr. Hunt. But I'll ask you a question
first&mdash;straight. Is there any doubt in your mind that that
young lady&mdash;your ward&mdash;killed Mrs. Hunt?"</p>

<p>I met his gray-blue glance directly, pausing a moment
before I spoke. "Sergeant Conlon," I replied, while a
meteor-shower of speculation shot through me with the
rapidity of light waves, "there is no doubt whatever in my
mind: Miss Blake could not&mdash;and so did not&mdash;kill my
wife."</p>

<p>"Who did, then?"</p>

<p>"Wait! Let me first ask you a question, sergeant: Who
sent for Doctor Askew?"</p>

<p>"That's the queerest part of it; Miss Blake did."</p>

<p>"Ah! <i>How?</i>"</p>

<p>"There's a 'phone in Mrs. Hunt's sittin' room. Miss
Blake called the house operator, gave her name and location,
and said not to waste a moment&mdash;to send up a doctor
double-quick!"</p>

<p>"Is that <i>all</i> she said?"</p>

<p>"No. The operator tells me she said Mrs. Hunt had had
a terrible accident and was dyin'."</p>

<p>"You're certain she said 'accident'?"</p>

<p>"The girl who was at the switchboard&mdash;name of Joyce&mdash;she's
sure of it."</p>

<p>I smiled, grimly enough. "Then that is exactly what
occurred, sergeant&mdash;a terrible accident; hideous. Your
question is answered. Nobody killed Mrs. Hunt&mdash;unless
you are so thoughtless or blasphemous as to call it an act
of God!"</p>

<p>"Oh, come on now!" he objected, shaking his head, but
not, I felt, with entire conviction. "No," he continued
stubbornly, "I been turnin' that over too. But there's no
way an accident like that could 'a' happened. It's not
possible!"</p>

<p>"Fortunately," I insisted, "nothing else is possible!
Are you asking me to believe that a young, sensitive girl,
with an extraordinary imaginative sympathy for others&mdash;a
girl of brains and character, as all her friends have reason<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
to know&mdash;asking me to believe that she walked coolly
into my wife's room this evening, rushed savagely upon
her, wrested a paper knife from her hand, and then found
the sheer brute strength of will and arm to thrust it
through her eye deep into her brain? Are you further
asking me to believe that having done this frightful thing
she kept her wits about her, telephoned at once for a doctor&mdash;being
careful to call her crime an accident&mdash;and
so passed at once into a trance of some kind and walked
from the room with the bloody knife in her hand? What
possible motive could be strong enough to drive such a
girl to such a deed?"</p>

<p>"Jealousy," said Sergeant Conlon. "She wanted <i>you</i>&mdash;and
your wife stood in her way. That's what I get from
Mrs. Arthur."</p>

<p>"I see. But the three or four persons who know Miss
Blake and me best will tell you how absurd that is, and
you'll find their reasons for thinking so are very convincing.
Is Mr. Phar still about?"</p>

<p>"He is. I've detained him."</p>

<p>"What does he think of Mrs. Arthur's nonsensical
theory?"</p>

<p>"He's got a theory of his own," said Conlon; "and it
happens to be the same as mine."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Phar says Miss Blake's own father went mad&mdash;all
of a sudden; cut some fancy woman's throat, and his
own after! He thinks history's repeated itself, that's all.
So do I. Only a crazy woman could 'a' done this&mdash;just
this way. A strong man in his senses couldn't 'a' drove
that paper-knife home like that! But when a person goes
mad, sir, all rules are off. I seen too many cases. Things
happen you can't account for. Take the matter of that
dog now&mdash;his broken leg, eh? What are you to make of
that? And take this queer state she's in. There's no doubt
in my mind, Mr. Hunt&mdash;the poor girl's gone crazy, somehow.
You nor me can't tell how nor why. But it's back
of all this&mdash;that's sure."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Throughout all this coarse nightmare, this insane break
in Nature, as I have called it and must always regard it,
let me at least be honest. As Conlon spoke, for the tiniest
fraction of a second a desolating fear darted through me,
searing every nerve with white-hot pain. Was it true?
Might it not conceivably be true? But this single lightning-thrust
of doubt passed as it came. No, not as it came,
for it blotted all clearness, all power of voluntary thought
from my mind; but it left behind it a singular intensity of
vision. Even as the lightning-pang vanished, and while
time yet stood still, a moving picture that amounted to
hallucination began to play itself out before me. It was
like</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 10em;"><i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that last</i></span><br />
<i>Wild pageant of the accumulated past</i><br />
<i>That clangs and flashes for a drowning man.</i><br />
</div>

<p>I saw Susan shutting the door of a delicately panelled
Georgian room, and every detail of this room&mdash;a room I
had never entered in the flesh&mdash;was distinct to me. Given
time, I could have inventoried its every object. I saw Gertrude
lying on&mdash;not a couch, as Conlon had called it&mdash;on a
<i>chaise-longue</i>, a book with a vivid green cover in her left
hand, a bronze paper knife with a thin, pointed blade in
her right. She was holding it with the knuckles of her
hand upward, her thumb along the handle, and the point
of the blade turned to her left, across and a little in toward
her body. She was wearing a very lovely <i>n&eacute;glig&eacute;</i>, a true
creation, all in filmy tones of old gold. On a low-set tip-table
at her elbow stood a reading-lamp, and a small coal-black
French bull lay asleep on a superb Chinese rug&mdash;lay
close in by the <i>chaise-longue</i>, just where a dropped hand
might caress him. A light silky-looking coverlet of a peculiar
dull blue, harmonizing with certain tones of the rug,
was thrown across Gertrude's feet.</p>

<p>As Susan shut the door, the little bull pricked up his
bat-ears and started to uncurl, but Gertrude must have
spoken to him, for he settled back again&mdash;not, however, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
sleep. It was all a picture; I heard no sounds. Then I
saw Gertrude put down her book on the table and swing
her feet from the <i>chaise-longue</i>, meaning to rise and greet
Susan. But, as she attempted to stand up, the light coverlet
entangled her feet and tripped her; she lost her balance,
tried with a violent, awkward lurch of her whole body to
recover herself, and stamped rather than stepped full on
the dog's forepaws. He writhed, springing up between her
feet&mdash;the whole grotesque catastrophe was, in effect, a
single, fatal gesture!&mdash;and Gertrude, throwing her hands
instinctively before her face, fell heavily forward, the
length of her body, prone. I saw Susan rush toward
her&mdash;&mdash; And the psychic reel flickered out, blanked.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I needed to see no more.</p>

<p>"Don't you agree with me, Mr. Hunt?" Conlon was
asking.</p>

<p>"No," I said bluntly. "No madwoman would have summoned
a doctor. Miss Blake called it a terrible accident.
It was. Her present state is due to the horror of it. When
she wakes, it will all be explained. Now take me to her."</p>

<p>Conlon's gray-blue glance fixed me once more. "All
right," he grunted, "I've no objections. But I'd 'a'
thought your first wish would 'a' been to see your wife."</p>

<p>"No," I replied. "Mrs. Hunt separated from me years
ago, for reasons of her own. I bore her no ill will; in a
sense, I respected her, admired her. Understand me, Sergeant
Conlon. There was nothing vulgar in her life, and
her death in this stupid way&mdash;oh, it's indecent, damnable!
A cheap outrage! I could do nothing for her living, and
can do nothing now. But I prefer to remember her as she
was. <i>She</i> would prefer it, too."</p>

<p>"Come on, then," said Conlon; pretty gruffly, I thought.</p>

<p>He unlocked the door.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>It was a singular thing, but so convincing had my vision
been to me that I felt no immediate desire to verify the
details of its setting by an examination of Gertrude's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
boudoir. It had come to me bearing its own credentials, its
own satisfying accent of truth. One question did, however,
fasten upon me, as I followed Conlon's bulky form,
down the hall to Lucette's bedroom. Whence had this
vision, this psychic reel come to me? What was its source?
How could the mere fact of it&mdash;clearing, as it did, at least,
all perplexities from my own mind&mdash;have occurred? For
the moment I could find no answer; the mystery had happened,
had worked, but remained a mystery.</p>

<p>Like most men in this modern world I had taken a vague,
mild interest in psychical research, reading more or less
casually, and with customary suspension of judgment, anything
of the sort that came in my way. I had a bowing
acquaintance with its rapidly growing literature; little
more; and until now I had had no striking psychical experiences
of my own, and had never, as it happened,
attended a s&eacute;ance of any kind, either popular or scientific.
Nevertheless, I could&mdash;to put it so&mdash;speak that language.
I was familiar with the described phenomena, in a general
way, and with the conflicting theories of its leading investigators;
but I had&mdash;honestly speaking&mdash;no pet theories of
my own, though always impatient of spiritistic explanations,
and rather inclined to doubt, too, the persistent claim
that thought transference had been incontrovertibly established.
On the whole, I suppose I was inclined to favor
common-sense mechanistic explanations of such phenomena,
and to regard all others with alert suspicion or wearily
amused contempt.</p>

<p>Now at last, in my life's most urgent crisis, I had had
news from nowhere; now, furthermore, the being I loved
and would protect, <i>must</i> protect, had been thrown by
psychic shock into that grim borderland, the Abnormal:
that land of lost voices, of the fringe of consciousness, of
dissociated personalities, of morbid obsession, and wild
symbolic dreams. Following on Conlon's heels, then, I
entered a softly illumined room&mdash;a restrained <i>Louis Seize</i>
room&mdash;a true Gertrude room, with its cool French-gray
panelled walls; but entered there as into sinister darkness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
as if groping for light. The comfortably accustomed, the
predictable, I felt, lay all behind me; I must step warily
henceforth among shifting shadows and phosphoric blurs.
The issues were too terrifying, too vast, for even one little
false move; Susan's future, the very health of her soul,
might depend now upon the blundering clumsiness or the
instinctive tact with which I attempted to pick and choose
my way. It was with a secret shuddering of flesh and
spirit that I entered that discreet, faultless room.</p>

<p>Susan was lying on the low single French bed, a coverlet
drawn over her; they had removed her trim tailored hat,
the jacket of her dark suit, and her walking-boots, leaving
them on the couch by the silk-curtained windows, where
they had perhaps first placed her. She had not dressed for
the evening before coming up to Gertrude's; it was evidently
to have been a businesslike call. Her black weblike
hair&mdash;smoky, I always called it, to tease her; it never fell
lank or separated into strings&mdash;had been disordered, and
a floating weft of it had drifted across her forehead and
hung there. Her face was moon-white, her lips pale, the
lines of cheek and chin had sharpened, her eyes were
closed. It was very like death. My throat tightened and
ached.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Doctor Askew stood across the bed from us, looking down
at her.</p>

<p>"Here's Mr. Hunt," said Conlon, without further introduction.
"He wants to see you." Then he stepped back
to the door and shut it, remaining over by it, at some distance
from the bed. His silence was expressive. "Now
show me!" it seemed to say. "This may be a big case for
me and it may not. If not, I'm satisfied; I'm ready for
anything. Go on, show me!"</p>

<p>Doctor Askew was not, as I had expected to find him,
old; nor even middle-aged; an expectation caught, I presume,
from Conlon's laconic "One of the best&mdash;a big rep";
he was, I now estimated, a year or so younger than I. I
had never heard of him and knew nothing about him, but
I liked him at once when he glanced humorously up at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Conlon's "He wants to see you," nodded to me, and said:
"I've been hoping you'd come soon, Mr. Hunt. I've a
mind to try something here&mdash;if you've no objection to an
experiment?"</p>

<p>He was a short man, not fat, but thickset like Conlon;
only, with a higher-strung vitality, carrying with it a sense
of intellectual eagerness and edge. He had a sandy,
freckled complexion, bronzy, crisp-looking hair with reddish
gleams in it, and an unmistakably red, aggressive mustache,
close-clipped but untamed. Green-blue eyes. A
man, I decided, of many intensities; a willful man; but
thoughtful, too, and seldom unkind.</p>

<p>"Why did you wait for my permission?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have&mdash;much longer," he replied, his eyes
returning to Susan's unchanging face. "But I've read
one or two of your essays, so I know something of the feel
of your mind. It occurred to me you might be useful.
And besides, I badly need some information about this"&mdash;he
paused briefly&mdash;"this very lovely child." Again he
paused a moment, adding: "This is a singular case, Mr.
Hunt&mdash;and likely to prove more singular as we see it
through. I acted too impulsively in sending for Conlon;
I apologize. It's not a police matter, as I at first supposed.
However, I hope there's no harm done. Conlon is holding
his horses and trying to be discreet. Aren't you, Conlon?"</p>

<p>"What's the idea?" muttered Conlon, from the doorway;
Conlon was not used to being treated thus, <i>de haut
en bas</i>. "Even if that poor little girl's crazy, we'll have
to swear out a warrant for her. It's a police matter all
right."</p>

<p>"I think <i>not</i>," said Doctor Askew, dismissing Conlon
from the conversation. "Have you ever," he then asked
me, "seen Miss Blake like this before?"</p>

<p>I was about to say "No!" with emphasis, when a sudden
memory returned to me&mdash;the memory of a queer, crumpled
little figure lying on the concrete incline of the Eureka
Garage; curled up there, like an unearthed cutworm,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
round a shining dinner-pail. "Yes," I replied instead;
"once&mdash;I think."</p>

<p>"You think?"</p>

<p>I sketched the occasion for him and explained all its
implications as clearly and briefly as I could; and while I
talked thus across her bed Susan's eyes did not open; she
did not stir. Doctor Askew heard me out, as I felt, intently,
but kept his eye meanwhile&mdash;except for a keen glance or
two in my direction&mdash;on Susan's face.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, when I had concluded; "that
throws more or less light. There's nothing to worry us, at
least, in Miss Blake's condition. Under psychical trauma&mdash;shock&mdash;she
has a tendency to pass into a trance state&mdash;amounting
practically to one of the deeper stages of hypnosis.
She'll come out of it sooner or later&mdash;simply wake
up&mdash;if we leave her alone. Perhaps, after all, that's the
wisest thing for us to do."</p>

<p>On this conclusion he walked away from the bed, as if
it ended the matter, and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Well, Conlon," he grinned, "we're making a night of
it, eh? Come, let's all sit down and talk things over." He
seated himself on the end of the couch as he spoke, lounging
back on one elbow and crossing his knees. "I ought
to tell you, Mr. Hunt," he added, "that nervous disorders
are my specialty; more than that, indeed&mdash;my life! I
studied under Janet in Paris, and later put in a couple
of years as assistant physician in the Clinic of Psychiatry,
Zurich. Did some work, too, at Vienna&mdash;with Stekel and
Freud. So I needn't say a problem of this kind is simply
meat and drink to me. I wouldn't have missed it for
anything in the world!"</p>

<p>I was a little chilled by his words, by an attitude that
seemed to me cold-bloodedly professional; nevertheless, I
joined him, drawing up a chair, and Conlon gradually
worked his way toward us, though he remained standing.</p>

<p>"What I want to know, doc," demanded Conlon, "is
why you've changed your mind?"</p>

<p>"I haven't," Doctor Askew responded. "I can't have,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
because I haven't yet formed an opinion. I'm just beginning
to&mdash;and even that may take me some time." He
turned to me. "What's your theory, Mr. Hunt?"</p>

<p>I was prepared for this question; my mind had been
busying itself foresightedly with every possible turn our
conversation was likely to take. All my faculties were
sharpened by strain, by my pressing sense that Susan's
future, for good or evil, might somehow be linked to my
lightest word. I had determined, then, in advance, not to
speak in Conlon's presence of my inexplicable vision, not
to mention it at all to anyone unless some unexpected turn
of the wheel might make it seem expedient. I could use it
to Susan's advantage, I believed, more effectively by
indirection; I endeavored to do so now.</p>

<p>"My theory?" I queried.</p>

<p>"As to how Mrs. Hunt met her death. However painful,
we've got to face that out, sooner or later."</p>

<p>"Naturally. But I have no theory," I replied; "I have
an unshakable conviction."</p>

<p>"Ah! Which is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That the whole thing was accidental, of course; just as
Miss Blake affirmed it to be over the telephone."</p>

<p>"You believe that <i>because</i> she affirmed it?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"That won't go down with the coroner," struck in Conlon.
"How could it? I'd like to think it, well enough&mdash;but
it don't with me!"</p>

<p>"Wait, Conlon!" suggested Doctor Askew, sharply.
"I'll conduct this inquiry just now, if you don't mind&mdash;and
if Mr. Hunt will be good enough to answer."</p>

<p>"Why not?" I replied.</p>

<p>"Thank you. Conlon's point is a good one, all the same.
Have you been able to form any reasonable notion of how
such an accident could have occurred?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The hell you have!" exclaimed Conlon excitedly, not
meaning, I think, to be sarcastic. "Why, you haven't even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
been in there"&mdash;he referred to Gertrude's boudoir&mdash;"or
seen the body!"</p>

<p>"No," I responded, "but you and Doctor Askew have,
so you can easily put me right. Extraordinary as the
whole thing is&mdash;the one deadly chance in perhaps a million&mdash;there's
nothing impossible about it. Merely from the
facts you've given me, Sergeant Conlon, I can reconstruct
the whole scene&mdash;come pretty near it, at any rate. But the
strength of my conviction is based on other grounds&mdash;don't
lose sight of that! Miss Blake didn't kill Mrs. Hunt; she's
incapable of such an action; and if she didn't, no one else
did. An accident is the only alternative."</p>

<p>"Well, then," grunted Conlon, "tell us about it! It'll
take some tellin'!"</p>

<p>"Hold on!" exclaimed Doctor Askew before I could
begin. "Sorry, Mr. Hunt&mdash;but you remember, perhaps&mdash;when
you first came in&mdash;I had half a mind to try something&mdash;an
experiment?" I nodded. "Well, I've made up
my mind. We'll try it right now, before it's too late. If it
succeeds, it may yield us a few facts to go on. Your suppositions
can come afterward."</p>

<p>I felt, as he spoke, that something behind his words belied
their rudeness, that their rudeness was rather for Conlon's
benefit than for mine. He got up briskly and crossed to
the bedside. There after a moment he turned and motioned
us both to join him.</p>

<p>As we did so, tiptoeing instinctively: "Yes&mdash;this is fortunate,"
he said; "she's at it again. Look."</p>

<p>Susan still lay as I had first seen her, with shut eyes,
her arms extended outside the coverlet; but she was no
longer entirely motionless. Her left arm lay relaxed, the
palm of her left hand upward. I had often seen her hands
lie inertly thus in her lap, the palms upward, in those
moments of silent withdrawal which I have more than once
described. But now her right hand was turned downward,
the fingers slightly contracted, as if they held a pen, and
the hand was creeping slowly on the coverlet from left to
right; it would creep slowly in this way for perhaps eight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
inches, then draw quickly back to its point of starting and
repeat the man&oelig;uvre. It was uncanny, this patient repetition&mdash;over
and over&mdash;of a single restricted movement.</p>

<p>"My God," came from Conlon in a husky whisper, "is
she dyin'&mdash;or what?"</p>

<p>"Far from it!" said Doctor Askew, his abrupt, crisp
speech in almost ludicrous contrast to Conlon's sudden awe.
"Get me some paper from that desk over there, Conlon. A
pad, if possible."</p>

<p>He drew out a pencil from his pocket as he spoke. Conlon
hesitated an instant, then obeyed, tiptoeing ponderously,
with creaking boots, over to a daintily appointed
writing-table, and returning with a block of linen paper.
Doctor Askew, meanwhile, holding the pencil between his
teeth, had lifted Susan's unresisting shoulders&mdash;too
roughly, I thought&mdash;from the bed.</p>

<p>"Stick that other pillow under her," he ordered me,
sharply enough in spite of the impeding pencil. "A little
farther down&mdash;so!"</p>

<p>Susan now lay, no less limply than before, with her
trunk, shoulders, and head somewhat raised. Her right
hand had ceased its slow, patient movement.</p>

<p>"What's the idea?" Conlon was muttering. "What's
the idea, doc?"</p>

<p>Whatever it was, it was evident that Conlon didn't
like it.</p>

<p>"Got the pad?" demanded Doctor Askew. "Oh, good!
Here!"</p>

<p>He almost snatched the pad from Conlon and tore the
blotter cover from it; then he slipped it beneath Susan's
right palm and finally thrust his pencil between her curved
fingers, its point resting on the linen block, which he
steadied by holding one corner between finger and thumb.
For a moment the hand remained quiet; then it began to
write. I say "it" advisedly; no least trace of consciousness
or purposed control could be detected in Susan's
impassive face or heavily relaxed body. <i>Susan</i> was not
writing; her waking will had no part in this strange automatism;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
so much, at least, was plain to me and even to
Conlon.</p>

<p>"Mother of God," came his throaty whisper again, "it's
not <i>her</i> that's doin' it. Who's pushin' that hand?"</p>

<p>"It's not <i>sperits</i>, Conlon," said Doctor Askew ironically;
"you can take my say-so for that." With the words
he withdrew the scribbled top sheet from the pad, glanced
at it, and handed it to me. The hand journeyed on, covering
a second sheet as I read. "That doesn't help us much,
does it?" was Doctor Askew's comment, when I had devoured
the first sheet.</p>

<p>"No," I replied; "not directly. But I'll keep this if
you don't mind."</p>

<p>I folded the sheet and slipped it into my pocket. Doctor
Askew removed the second sheet.</p>

<p>"Same sort of stuff," he grunted, passing it over to me.
"It needs direction." And he began addressing&mdash;not
<i>Susan</i>, to Conlon's amazement&mdash;the <i>hand!</i> "What happened
in Mrs. Hunt's room to-night?" he demanded firmly
of the hand. "Tell us exactly what happened in Mrs.
Hunt's room to-night! It's important. What happened
in Mrs. Hunt's room to-night?"</p>

<p>Always addressing the hand, his full attention fixed upon
it as it moved, he repeated this burden over and over. "We
must know exactly what happened in Mrs. Hunt's room
to-night! Tell us what happened in Mrs. Hunt's room
to-night.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What happened in Mrs. Hunt's room to-night?"</p>

<p>Conlon and I both noted that Susan's breathing, hitherto
barely to be detected, gradually grew more labored while
Doctor Askew insisted upon and pressed home his monotonous
refrain. He had so placed himself now that he could
follow the slowly pencilled words. More and more deliberately
the hand moved; then it paused.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"What happened in Mrs. Hunt's room to-night?"
chanted Doctor Askew.</p>

<p>"This ain't right," muttered Conlon. "It's worse'n the
third degree. I don't like it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>He creaked uneasily away. The hand moved again, hesitatingly,
briefly.</p>

<p>"Ah," chanted Doctor Askew&mdash;always to the hand&mdash;"it
was an accident, was it? How did it happen? Tell us
exactly how it happened&mdash;exactly how it happened. <i>We
must know</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How did the accident happen in Mrs.
Hunt's room to-night?"</p>

<p>Again the hand moved, more steadily this time, and
seemingly in response to his questions.</p>

<p>Doctor Askew glanced up at me with an encouraging
smile. "We'll get it now&mdash;all of it. Don't worry. The
hand's responding to control."</p>

<p>Though sufficiently astonished and disturbed by this performance,
I was not, like Conlon, wholly at sea. Sober
accounts of automatic writing could be found in all modern
psychologies; I had read some of these accounts&mdash;given
with all the dry detachment of clinical data. They had
interested me, not thrilled me. No supernatural power was
involved. It was merely the comparative rarity of such
phenomena in the ordinary normal course of experience
that made them seem awe-inspiring. And yet, the <i>hand</i>
there, solely animate, patiently writing in entire independence
of a consciously directing will&mdash;&mdash;! My spine,
too, like Conlon's, registered an authentic shiver of protest
and atavistic fear. But, throughout, I kept my tautened
wits about me, busily working; and they drove me now on
a sudden inspiration to the writing-table, where I seized
pen and paper and wrote down with the most collected
celerity a condensed account of&mdash;for so I phrased it&mdash;"what
must, from the established facts, be supposed to
have taken place in Mrs. Hunt's boudoir, just after Miss
Blake had entered it." I put this account deliberately as
my theory of the matter, as the one solution of the problem
consistent with the given facts and the known characters
involved; and I had barely concluded when I was startled
to my feet by Doctor Askew's voice&mdash;raised cheerily above
its monotonous murmur of questions to the hand&mdash;calling
my name.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you up to, Mr. Hunt? My little experiment's
over. It's a complete success."</p>

<p>He was walking toward me with a handful of loose scribbled
sheets from the linen block.</p>

<p>"How is she now?" I inquired anxiously, as if she had
just been subjected to a dangerous operation.</p>

<p>"All right. Deep under. I shan't try to pull her out
yet. Much better for her to come out of it naturally herself.
I suggest we darken the room and leave her."</p>

<p>"That suits <i>me!</i>" I just caught from Conlon, over by
the door.</p>

<p>"She'll be quite safe alone?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely. I want to read this thing to Conlon and
Mrs. Arthur and Mr. Phar, before the coroner gets here.
I rather think they'll find it convincing."</p>

<p>"Good," I responded. "But, first of all, let me read
them this. I've just jotted down my analysis of the whole
situation. It's a piece of cold constructive reasoning from
the admitted data, and I shall be greatly surprised if it
doesn't on the whole agree with what you've been able to
obtain."</p>

<p>Doctor Askew stared at me a moment curiously. "And
if it doesn't agree?" he asked.</p>

<p>"If it don't," exclaimed Conlon, with obvious relief, "it
may help us, all the same! This thing can't be settled by
<i>that</i> kind of stuff, doc." He gave a would-be contemptuous
nod toward Doctor Askew's handful of scrawled pages.
"That's no evidence&mdash;whatever it says. Where does it
come from? Who's givin' it? It can't be sworn to on the
Book, that's certain&mdash;eh? Let's get outa here and begin
to talk sense!" Conlon opened the door eagerly, and
creaked off through the hall.</p>

<p>"Go with him," ordered Doctor Askew. "I'll put out
the lights." Then he touched my elbow and gave me a
slight nod. "I see your point of course. But I hope to
God you've hit somewhere near it?"</p>

<p>"Doctor," I replied, "this account of mine is exact. I'll
tell you later how I know that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah!" he grunted, with a green-blue flash of eyes.
"What a lucky devil I am!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I've felt all along
this would prove a rewarding case."</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Up to this point I have been necessarily thus detailed,
but I am eager now to win past the cruder melodrama of
this insanely disordered night. I am eager to win back
from all these damnable and distracting things to Susan.
This book is hers, not mine; it is certainly not Sergeant
Conlon's or Doctor Askew's. So you will forgive me, and
understand, if I present little more than a summary of the
immediately following hours.</p>

<p>We found Maltby and Lucette in the drawing-room,
worn out with their night-long vigil; Maltby, somnolent
and savage; Lucette still keyed high, suffering from exasperated
nerves which&mdash;perhaps for the first time in her
life&mdash;she could not control. They were seated as far apart
as the room permitted, having long since talked themselves
out, and were engaged, I think, in tacitly hating one
another. The situation was almost impossible; yet I knew
I must dominate it somehow, and begin by dominating
myself&mdash;and in the end, with Conlon's and Doctor Askew's
help, I succeeded. Conlon, I confess, proved to be an unexpected
ally all through.</p>

<p>"Now, Mrs. Arthur, and you, Mr. Phar," he stated at
once as we entered the drawing-room together, "I've
brought Mr. Hunt in here to read you his guess at what
happened last evenin'. Doctor Askew'll be with us in a
minute, and <i>he's</i> got somethin' to lay before you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
No; Miss Blake's not come round yet. The doc'll explain
about her. But we'll hear from Mr. Hunt first, see? I've
examined him and I'm satisfied he's straight. You've
known him long enough to form your own opinions, but
that's mine. Oh, here's the doc! Go on, Mr. Hunt."</p>

<p>With this lead, I was at length able to persuade Lucette
and Maltby to listen, sullenly enough, to my written analysis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
My feeling toward them both, though better concealed,
was quite as hostile as theirs toward me, but I saw
that I caught their reluctant attention and that Maltby
was somewhat impressed by what I had written, and by my
interjected amplifications of the more salient points. I had
been careful to introduce no facts not given me by Sergeant
Conlon, and when I had finished, ignoring Lucette's instant
murmur of impatience and incredulity, I turned to him
and said: "Sergeant, is there anything known to you and
not known to me&mdash;any one detail discovered during your
examination of Mrs. Hunt's boudoir, say&mdash;which makes my
deductions impossible or absurd?"</p>

<p>He reflected a moment, then acknowledged: "Well, no,
Mr. Hunt. Things might 'a' happened like that; maybe
they did. But just sayin' so don't prove they did!"</p>

<p>"May I ask you a few questions?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Had Mrs. Hunt's body been moved when you arrived?
I mean, from the very spot where it fell?"</p>

<p>"It had and it hadn't. The doc here found her lyin'
face down on the floor, right in front of the couch. He
had to roll her over on her back to examine her. That's
all. The body's there now like that, covered with a sheet.
Nothin' else has been disturbed."</p>

<p>"The body was lying face down, you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes," struck in Doctor Askew; "it was."</p>

<p>"At full length?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Isn't that rather surprising?"</p>

<p>"Unquestionably."</p>

<p>"How do you account for the position?"</p>

<p>"There's only one possible explanation," replied Doctor
Askew, as if giving expert testimony from a witness box;
"a sudden and complete loss of balance, pitching the body
sharply forward, accompanied by such a binding of the
legs and feet as to prevent any instinctive movement
toward recovery."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you. Were there any indications of such binding?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Mrs. Hunt's trailing draperies had somehow
wound themselves tightly about her legs below the knee,
and I judge her feet were further impeded by a sort of
coverlet which I found touselled up on the rug beneath
them."</p>

<p>"Grant all that!" growled Maltby. "It points to just
the opposite of what we'd all like to think is true. If Mrs.
Hunt had risen slowly to greet a caller in the usual way&mdash;well,
she wouldn't have gotten herself tangled up. She
was the last woman in the world to do anything awkwardly.
But if she leaped to her feet in terror&mdash;what?
To defend herself&mdash;or try to escape? Don't you see?"</p>

<p>"Of course we see!" cried Lucette. "It proves everything!"</p>

<p>"Hardly," I replied. "Try to imagine the scene, Maltby,
as you seem to believe it occurred. I won't speak of the
major impossibility&mdash;that Susan, a girl you've known and
have asked to be your wife, could under any circumstances
be the author of such a crime! We'll pass that. Simply
try to picture the crime itself. Susan, showing no traces
of unnatural excitement, is conducted to my wife's boudoir.
She enters, shuts the door, turns, then rushes at her with
so hideous an effect of insane fury that Gertrude springs
up, terrified. Susan&mdash;more slightly built than Gertrude,
remember!&mdash;grapples with her, tears a paper knife from
her hand, and plunges it deep into her eye, penetrating the
brain. Suppose, if you will, that madness lent her this
force. But, obviously, for the point of the knife to enter
the eye in that way, Gertrude must have been fronting
Susan, her chin well raised. Obviously, the force of such
a blow would have thrown her head, her whole body, backward,
not forward; and if her feet were bound, as Doctor
Askew says they were, she must have fallen backward or
to one side, certainly not forward at full length, on her
face."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"You've said somethin' this time, Mr. Hunt!" exclaimed
Conlon. "There's a lot to that!"</p>

<p>Maltby was visibly impressed; but not Lucette. "As if,"
she said, "Susan wouldn't have arranged the body&mdash;afterward&mdash;in
any way she thought to her advantage!"</p>

<p>"There wasn't time!" Doctor Askew objected impatiently.
"And," he went on, "it happens that all this is
futile! I have proof here, corroborating Mr. Hunt's
remarkably acute theories in the most positive way."</p>

<p>But before reading what Susan's hand had written, he
turned to Sergeant Conlon, requesting his close attention,
and then gave him briefly a popular lecture on the nature
of automatic writing as understood by a tough-minded
neurologist with no faith in the supernatural. It was
really a masterly performance in its way, for he avoided
the jargon of science and cut down to essentials.</p>

<p>"Conlon," he said, "you've often forgotten something,
tried to recall it, and finally given it up. We all have.
And then some day, when you least expected it and were
thinking of something else, that forgotten something has
popped into your mind again&mdash;eh? All right. Where was
it in the meantime, when you couldn't put your finger on
it? Since it eventually came back, it must have been preserved
somewhere. That's plain enough, isn't it? But
when you say something you've forgotten 'pops into your
mind' again, you're wrong. It's never been out of your
mind. What too many of us still don't know is that a
man's mind has two parts to it. One part, much the smallest,
is consciousness&mdash;the part we're using now, the part
we're always aware of. The other part is a big dark storehouse,
where pretty much everything we've forgotten is
kept. We're not aware of the storehouse or the things kept
in it, so the ordinary man doesn't know anything about it.
You're not aware of your spleen, and wouldn't know you
had one if doctors hadn't cut up a lot of people and found
spleens in every one of them. You believe you've got a
spleen because we doctors tell you so. Well, I'm telling
you now that your mind has a big storehouse, where most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
of the things you've forgotten are preserved. We mind-doctors
call it your Unconscious Mind. All clear so far?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Good.</p>

<p>"Now then&mdash;when a man's hypnotized, it means his conscious
mind has been put to sleep, practically, and his
unconscious mind has, in a sense, waked up. When a man's
hypnotized we can fish all sorts of queer things from his
big storehouse, his unconscious mind; things he didn't
know were there, things he'd forgotten.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And it's the
same with what we call trances. A man in a trance is a
man whose conscious mind is asleep and whose unconscious
mind is awake.</p>

<p>"That's exactly Miss Blake's condition now. The shock
of what she saw last evening threw her into a trance; she
doesn't know what's going on round her&mdash;but her unconscious
mind has a record, a sort of phonograph-record of
more or less everything that's ever happened to her, and if
she speaks or writes in this trance state she'd simply play
one of these stored-up records for us; play it just like a
phonograph, automatically. Her will power's out of commission,
you see; in this state she's nothing more nor less
than a highly complicated instrument. And the record she
plays may be of no interest to anybody; some long-forgotten
incident or experience of childhood, for example.
On the other hand, if we can get the right record going&mdash;eh?&mdash;we've
every chance of finding out exactly what we
want to know!" He paused, fixing his already attentive
pupil with his peculiarly vivid green-blue glance.</p>

<p>"Now, Conlon, <i>get</i> this&mdash;it's important! I must ask you
to believe one other thing about the Unconscious Mind&mdash;simply
take it on my say-so, as a proved fact: When the
conscious mind is temporarily out of business&mdash;as under
hypnotism, or in trance&mdash;the unconscious mind, like the
sensitive instrument it is, will often obey or respond to
outside suggestions. I can't go into all this, of course. But
what I ask you to believe about Miss Blake is this: In her
present state of trance, at my suggestion, <i>she has played
the right record for us!</i> She has automatically written<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
down for us an account of her experiences last evening.
And I assure you this account, obtained in this way, is far
more reliable and far more complete than any she could
give us in her normal, conscious, waking state. There's
nothing marvellous or weird about it, Conlon. We have
here"&mdash;and he slightly rattled the loose sheets in his hand&mdash;"simply
an automatic record of stored-up impressions.
Do you see?"</p>

<p>Conlon grunted that he guessed maybe he saw; at any
rate, he was willing to be shown.</p>

<p>Then Doctor Askew read us Susan's own story of the
strange, idiotically meaningless accident to Gertrude. As
it corresponded in every particular with my vision, I shall
not repeat it; but it produced an enormous impression on
Sergeant Conlon and Maltby, and even on Lucette. Taken
in connection with my independent theory of what must
have occurred, they found Susan's story entirely convincing;
though whether Lucette really found it so or had
suddenly decided&mdash;because of certain uncomfortable accusations
against herself made by Susan's hand&mdash;that the
whole matter had gone quite far enough and any further
publicity would be a mistake, I must leave to your later
judgment.</p>

<p>As for the coroner, when at length he arrived, he too&mdash;to
my astonishment and unspeakable relief&mdash;accepted
Susan's automatic story without delay or demur. Here
was a stroke of sheer good luck, for a grateful change&mdash;but
quite as senseless in itself, when seriously considered,
as the cruel accident to Gertrude. It merely <i>happened</i>
that the coroner's sister was a professional medium, and
that he and his whole family were ardent believers in
spiritualism, active missionaries in that cause. He had
started life as an East Side street-urchin, had the coroner,
and had scrambled up somehow from bondage to influence,
fighting his way single-fisted through a hard school that
does not often foster illusions; but I have never met a
more eagerly credulous mind. He accepted the automatic
writing as evidence without a moment's cavil, assuring us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
at once that it undoubtedly came as a direct message from
the dead.</p>

<p>Doctor Askew's preliminary explanations he simply
brushed aside. If Miss Blake in her present trance state,
which he soon satisfied himself was genuine, had produced
this message, then her hand had been controlled by a disembodied
spirit&mdash;probably Mrs. Hunt's. There was no
arguing with the man, and on my part, heaven knows, no
desire to oppose him! I listened gratefully for one hour
to his wonder tales of spirit revelations, and blessed him
when he reluctantly left us&mdash;with the assurance that Gertrude's
death would be at once reported as due to an
unavoidable accident. It was so announced in the noon
editions of the evening papers. Sergeant Conlon and his
aids departed by the service elevator, and were soon
replaced by a shocked and grieved clergyman and a competent
undertaker. The funeral&mdash;to take place in New
Haven&mdash;was arranged for; telegrams were sent; one among
them to Phil. Even poor Miss Goucher was at last remembered
and communicated with&mdash;only just in time, I fear,
to save her reason. But of her more in its place. And,
meanwhile, throughout all this necessary confusion, Susan
slept on. Noon was past, and she still slept.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And
Doctor Askew and I watched beside her, and talked together.</p>

<p>At precisely seven minutes to three&mdash;I was bending over
her at the moment, studying her face for any sign of stirring
consciousness&mdash;she quietly opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"Ambo," were her first words, "I believe in God now;
a God, anyway. I believe in <i>Setebos</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>In my unpracticed, disorderly way&mdash;in the hurry of my
desire to get back to Susan&mdash;I have again overstepped
myself and must, after all, pause to make certain necessary
matters plain. There is nothing else for it. I have, on
reflection, dropped too many threads&mdash;the thread of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
own vision, the thread of those first two or three pages
scrawled by Susan before her hand had fully responded to
Doctor Askew's control; other weakly fluttering, loose-ended
threads! My respect for the great narrative writers
is increasing enormously, as I bungle onward. "Order is
heaven's first law," and I wish to heaven it might also
more instinctively be mine!</p>

<p>Just after the coroner's departure Maltby left us, but
before he left I insisted upon a brief talk with him in
Lucette's presence. I was in no mood for tact.</p>

<p>"Maltby," I said, "I can't stop now for anything but
the plain statement that you've been a bad friend&mdash;to
Susan and me. As for you, Lucette, it's perfectly clear
now that Susan believes you responsible for spreading a
slanderous lie about her. Between you, directly or indirectly,
you've managed to get it believed down here that
Susan has been my mistress and was forced to leave New
Haven because the scandal had grown notorious. That's
why Susan came here, determined to see you, Lucette;
that's why Gertrude received her. Gertrude was never
underhanded, never a sneak. My guess is, that she suspected
you of slandering Susan, but wasn't sure; and then
Susan's unexpected call on you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lucette flared out at this, interrupting me. "I'm not
particularly interested in your guesswork, Ambrose Hunt!
We've had a good deal of it, already. Besides, I've a raging
headache, and I'm too utterly heartsick even to resent
your insults. But I'll say this: I've very strong reasons
for thinking that what you call a lying slander is a fact.
Mr. Phar can tell you why&mdash;if he cares to."</p>

<p>With that, she walked out of the room, and I did not see
her again until we met in New Haven at Gertrude's
funeral, on which occasion, with nicely calculated publicity,
she was pleased to cut me dead.</p>

<p>When she had gone I turned on Maltby.</p>

<p>"Well?" I demanded.</p>

<p>Maltby, I saw, was something more than ill-at-ease.</p>

<p>"Now see here, Boz," he began, "can't we talk this over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
without quarreling? It's so stupid, I mean&mdash;between men
of the world." I waited, without responding. "I'll be
frank with you," he mumbled at me. "Fact is, old man,
that night&mdash;the night Phil Farmer said Susan wanted to
see you&mdash;was waiting for you in your study&mdash;remember?
You promised to rejoin me shortly and talk things out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
But you didn't come back. Naturally, I've always supposed
since then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have a scoundrelly imagination!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>His face, green-pale from loss of sleep, slowly mottled
with purplish stains.</p>

<p>"Years of friendship," he stumbled, thick-voiced,
through broken phrases. "Wouldn't take that from any
one else.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Not yourself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Question of viewpoint,
really.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I'd be the last to blame either of you, if&mdash;&mdash; However&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Maltby," I said, "you're what I never thought you&mdash;a
common or garden cad. That's my deliberate opinion.
I've nothing more to say to you."</p>

<p>For an instant I supposed he was going to strike me.
It is one of the major disappointments of my life that
he did not. My fingers ached for his throat.</p>

<p>Later, with the undertaker efficiently in charge of all
practical arrangements, and while Susan still hid from us
behind her mysterious veil, I talked things out with Doctor
Askew, giving him the whole story of Susan as clearly and
unreservedly as I could. My purpose in doing so was two-fold.
I felt that he must know as much as possible about
Susan before she woke again to what we call reality. What
I feared was that this shock&mdash;which had so profoundly
and so peculiarly affected her&mdash;might, even after the long
and lengthening trance had passed, leave some mark upon
her spirit, perhaps even some permanent cloud upon her
brain. I had read enough of these matters to know that
my fear was not groundless, and I could see that Doctor
Askew welcomed my information&mdash;felt as keenly as I did
that he might later be called upon to interpret and deal
with some perplexing borderland condition of the mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
It was as well at least to be prepared. That was my major
purpose. But connected with it was another, more self-regarding.
My own vision, my psychic reel, greatly disturbed
me. It was not orthodox. It could not be explained,
for example, as something swiftly fabricated from covert
memories by my unconscious mind, and forced then sharply
into consciousness by some freak of circumstance, some
psychic perturbation or strain.</p>

<p>My vision of the accident itself&mdash;of the manner of its
occurrence&mdash;might conceivably have been such a fabrication,
subconsciously elaborated from the facts given me
by Conlon; not so my vision of its setting. I had seen in
vivid detail the interior of a room which I had never
entered and had never heard described; and every detail
thus seen was minutely accurate, for I had since examined
the room and had found nothing in it unfamiliar, nothing
that did not correspond with what my mind's eye had
already noted and remembered. Take merely one instance&mdash;the
pattern and color scheme of the Chinese rug beside
the <i>chaise-longue</i>. As an amateur in such matters I could
easily, in advance of physically looking at it, have catalogued
that rug and have estimated its value to a collector.
How then to account for this astounding clairvoyance? I
could not account for it without widening my whole conception
of what was psychically possible. Seated with Doctor
Askew in the room where Susan lay withdrawn from
us, from our normal world of limited concrete perceptions,
I was oppressed as never before by the immensity and
deluding vagueness of the unknown. What were we, we
men and women? Eternal forces, or creatures of an hour?
An echo, from days long past returned to me, Phil's quiet,
firm voice demanding&mdash;of Maltby, wasn't it? Yes, yes,
of course&mdash;demanding of Maltby: "<i>What is the world, may
I ask? And what is Susan?</i>"</p>

<p>Doctor Askew cross-questioned me closely as we sat there,
a little off from Susan, our eyes seldom leaving her face.
"You must have patience," he kept assuring me in the
midst of his questioning. "It will be much better for her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
to come out of this thing tranquilly, by herself. We're not
really wasting time." When his cross-questioning was
over he sat silent for a long time, biting at his upper lip,
tapping one foot&mdash;almost irritably, I thought&mdash;on the parquet
floor.</p>

<p>"I don't like it," he said finally, in his abrupt way. "I
don't like it because I believe you're telling the truth. If
I could only persuade myself that you are either lying or
at least drawing a long bow"&mdash;he gave a little disgusted
snort of laughter&mdash;"it would be a great relief to me!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Why? Because you're upsetting my scientific convictions.
My mind was all tidied up, everything nicely in
order, and now you come raging through it with this ridiculous
tale of a sudden hallucinating vision&mdash;of seeing things
that you'd never seen, never heard described&mdash;whose very
existence you were completely unaware of! Damn it! I'd
give almost anything to think you a cheerful liar&mdash;or self-deceived!
But I can't."</p>

<p>"Still, you must have met with similar cases?"</p>

<p>"Never, as it happens, with one that I couldn't explain
away to my own satisfaction. That's what irritates me
now. I can't explain you away, Mr. Hunt. I believe you
had that experience just as you describe it. Well, then, if
you had&mdash;what follows?" He pulled for a moment or two
at a stubby end of red mustache.</p>

<p>"What does?" I suggested.</p>

<p>"One of three things," he replied, "all equally impossible.
Either your vision&mdash;to call it that&mdash;was first
recorded in the mind of another living person and transferred
thence to yours&mdash;or it was not. If it wasn't, then
it came direct from God or the devil and was purely miraculous!
With your kind permission, we'll rule that out.
But if it was first recorded in the mind of another living
person, then we're forced to accept telepathy&mdash;complete
thought transference from a distance&mdash;accept it as a fact.
I never have so accepted it, and hate like hell to do it now!
And even if I could bring myself to accept it, my troubles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
have only begun. From whose mind was this exact vision
of the accident to Mrs. Hunt transferred to yours? So far
as I can see, the detailed facts of it could have been registered
in the minds of only two persons&mdash;Miss Blake and
your wife. Isn't that so?"</p>

<p>I agreed.</p>

<p>"All right. See where that leaves us! At the time you
received this vision, Miss Blake is lying here in a deep
trance, unconscious; and your wife is dead. Which of
these incredible sources of information do you prefer? It's
a matter of indifference to me. Either way my entire reasoned
conception of the universe topples in ruins!"</p>

<p>"But surely," I protested, "it might have come to me
from Miss Blake, as you suggest, without our having to
descend to a belief in spirit communication? Let's rule
that out, too!"</p>

<p>"As you please," smiled Doctor Askew, pretty grimly.
"If you find it easier to believe your vision came from Miss
Blake, do so by all means! Personally, I've no choice. I
can accept the one explanation quite as readily as the
other. Which means, that as a thinking being I can accept
neither! Both are&mdash;absurd. So I can go no further&mdash;unless
by a sheer act of faith. I'm baffled, you see&mdash;in my
own field; completely baffled. That's what it comes to.
And I find it all devilishly annoying and inconvenient.
Don't you?"</p>

<p>I did not reply. For a time I mused, drearily enough,
turning many comfortless things over in my mind. Then
I drew from my pocket the three sheets scribbled by
Susan's hand, before it had responded to Doctor Askew's
insistent suggestions.</p>

<p>"Doctor," I asked, handing him the scribbled pages, "in
view of all I've told you, doesn't what Miss Blake has
written here strike you as significant? You see," I added,
while he glanced through them, "how strongly her repressed
feelings are in revolt against me&mdash;against the
tyranny of my love for her. Doesn't it seem improbable,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
then, to say the least of it, that my vision could have come
from that direction?"</p>

<p>He was reading the pages through again, more slowly.
"Jimmy?" he queried to himself. "Oh, yes&mdash;Jimmy's the
boy you spoke of. I see&mdash;I see." He looked up, and I did
my best to smile.</p>

<p>"That's a bitter dose of truth for me, doctor; but thank
God it came in this way&mdash;came in time!"</p>

<p>Except for the punctuation, which I have roughly supplied,
the three pages read as follows:</p>

<p>"A net. No means of escape from it. To escape&mdash;somehow.
Jimmy&mdash;&mdash; Only wretchedness for Ambo&mdash;for us
both. How can he care! Insufferably self-satisfied; childishly
blind. I won't&mdash;I won't&mdash;not after this. No escape
from it&mdash;my net. But the inner net&mdash;Ambo's&mdash;binding
him, too. Some way out. A dead hand killing things. My
own father. How he killed and killed&mdash;always&mdash;more than
he knew. Blind. Never felt that before as part of me&mdash;of
me. Wrong way round though&mdash;it enfolds&mdash;smothers.
I'm tangled there&mdash;part of it&mdash;forever and ever. Setebos&mdash;God
of my father&mdash;Setebos knows. Oh, how could I
dream myself free of it like others&mdash;how could I! A net&mdash;all
a net&mdash;no breaking it. Poor Ambo&mdash;and his love too&mdash;a
net. It shan't hold me. I'll gnaw through&mdash;mouselike.
I must. Fatal for Ambo now if it holds me. Fatal&mdash;Setebos&mdash;Jimmy
will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hum," said Doctor Askew quietly.</p>

<p>"That doesn't help me much," I complained.</p>

<p>"No," he responded; "but I can't see that all this has
any bearing on the possible source of your vision."</p>

<p>"I only thought that perhaps this revelation of a repressed
inner revolt against me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see. But there's no reasoning about the unthinkable.
I've already said I can make nothing of your vision&mdash;nothing
I'm yet prepared to believe." He handed the
three sheets back to me with these words: "But I'm afraid
your interpretation of this thing is correct. It's a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
puzzling in spots&mdash;curious, eh, the references to Setebos?&mdash;still,
if I were you, Mr. Hunt, I should quietly withdraw
from a lost cause. It'll mean less trouble all round in the
end." He shook his head impatiently. "These sexual muddles&mdash;it's
better to see 'em out frankly! They're always
the devil, anyway! What silly mechanisms we are&mdash;how
Nature makes puppet-fools of us! That lovely child there&mdash;she
admires you and wants to love you, because you love
her. Why shouldn't she? What could be a happier
arrangement&mdash;now? You've had your share of marital
misfortune, I should say. But Nature doesn't give a damn
for happy arrangements! God knows what she's after, I
don't! But just at present she seems to be loading the dice
for Jimmy&mdash;for Jimmy, who perhaps isn't even interested
in the game! Well, such&mdash;for our misery or amusement&mdash;is
life! And my cigarettes are gone.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How about
yours&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>It did not take Susan long to make it perfectly clear
to Doctor Askew and me that she had waked from her
trance to complete lucidity, showing no traces of any of
the abnormal after-effects we had both been dreading. Her
first rather surprising words had been spoken just as she
opened her eyes and before she had quite realized anything
but my familiar presence beside her. They were
soon followed by an entirely natural astonishment and confusion.
What had happened? Where was she? She sat
up in bed and stared about her, her eyes coming to rest
on Doctor Askew's eager, observant face.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Doctor Askew," he replied quietly. "Don't be
alarmed, Miss Blake. Mr. Hunt and I have been looking
after you. Not that you've been much trouble," he smiled;
"on the contrary. You've been fast asleep for more than
twelve hours. We both envy you."</p>

<p>For a long two minutes she did not reply. Then, "Oh,
yes," she said. "Oh, yes." Her chin began to quiver,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
she visibly shuddered through her whole slight frame, and
for an instant pressed her palms hard against her eyes.
"Ambo," she murmured, "it was cruel&mdash;worse than anything!
I got to the 'phone all right, didn't I? Yes, I
remember that. I gave the message. But I knew I must
go back to her. So much blood, Ambo.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I'm a coward&mdash;oh,
I'm a coward! But I tried, I did try to go back!
Where <i>did</i> I go, Ambo?"</p>

<p>"You went to sleep like a sensible little woman!" struck
in Doctor Askew, briskly. "You'd done all you could, all
anyone could&mdash;so you went to sleep. I wish to God more
women under such circumstances would follow your
example! Much better than going all to pieces and making
a scene!"</p>

<p>Susan could not respond to his encouraging smile. "To
sleep!" she sighed miserably; "just as I did&mdash;once before.
What a coward I am! When awful things happen, I dodge
them&mdash;I run away."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, dear. You knew Gertrude was beyond helping,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but if she hadn't been?" She shook her head
impatiently. "You're both trying to be kind; but you
won't be able to make me forgive myself&mdash;not this time.
I don't rise to a crisis&mdash;I slump. Artemis wouldn't have;
nor Gertrude. You know that's true, Ambo. Even if I
could do nothing for her&mdash;there were others to think of.
There was you. I ought to have been helping you; not
you, me." She put out her hand to me. "You've done
everything for me, always&mdash;and I make no return. Now,
when I might have, I&mdash;I've been a quitter!"</p>

<p>Tears of shame and self-reproach poured from her eyes.
"Oh," she cried out with a sort of fierce disgust, "how
I hate a coward! How I hate myself!"</p>

<p>"Come, come!" protested Doctor Askew. "This won't
do, little lady!" He laid a firm hand on her shoulder and
almost roughly shook it, as if she had been a boy. "If
you're equal to it, I suggest you get up and wash your face
in good cold water. Do your hair, too&mdash;put yourself to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
rights! Things never look quite normal to a woman, you
know, when her hair's tumbling!" His hand slipped from
her shoulder to her upper arm; he drew the coverlet from
her, and helped her to rise. "All right? Feel your pins
under you?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Fine! Need a maid? No?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Splendid!
Come along, Mr. Hunt, we'll wait for the little lady
in the drawing-room. She'll soon pull herself together."</p>

<p>He joined me and walked with me to the door. Susan
had not moved as yet from the bedside.</p>

<p>"Ambo," she demanded unexpectedly, "does Sister
know?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"Why isn't she with me then? Is her cold worse?"</p>

<p>"Rather, I'm afraid. I've sent a doctor to her, with
instructions to keep her in bed if possible. We'll go right
down when you're ready and feel up to it."</p>

<p>"Why didn't I stay with her, Ambo? I should have.
If I had, all this wouldn't have happened. It was pure
selfishness, my coming here to see Mrs. Arthur. I simply
wanted the cheap satisfaction of telling her&mdash;oh, no matter!
I'll be ready in five minutes or less."</p>

<p>"Ah," laughed Doctor Askew, "then we know just what
to expect! I'll order my car round for you in half an
hour."</p>

<p>Phil and Jimmy arrived in town that afternoon and
I met them at the Brevoort, where the three of us took
rooms, with a sitting-room, for the night. I told them
everything that had occurred as fully as I could, with one
exception: I did not speak of those first three pages automatically
scribbled by Susan's hand. Nor did I mention
my impression&mdash;which was rapidly becoming a fixed idea&mdash;that
my love for her had darkened her life. This was my
private problem, my private desolation. It would be my
private duty to free Susan's spirit from this intolerable
strain. No one could help me here, not even Susan. In
all that most mattered to me, my isolation must from now
on be complete.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>All else I told them, not omitting my vision&mdash;the whole
wild story. And, finally, I had now to add to my devil's
list a new misfortune. We had found poor Miss Goucher's
condition much more serious than I had supposed. Doctor
Askew had taken us down in his car, and we were met in
the nondescript lower hall of the boarding-house by his
friend, Doctor Carl&mdash;the doctor whom I had sent to Miss
Goucher on his advice. Miss Goucher's heavy chest cold,
he at once informed us, had taken a graver turn; double
pneumonia had declared itself. Her fever was high and
she had lately grown delirious; he had put a trained nurse
in charge. The crisis of the disease would probably be
passed during the next twelve hours; he was doing everything
possible; he hoped for the best.</p>

<p>Susan, very white, motionless, had heard him out. "If
Sister dies," she had said quietly when he ended, "I shall
have killed her." Then she had run swiftly up the stairs
and the two doctors had followed her. I had remained
below and had not again seen her; but Doctor Askew had
returned within ten minutes, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"No one can say what will happen," I had finally
wrested from him. "One way or the other now, it's the
flip of a coin. Carl's doing his best&mdash;that is, nothing, since
there's nothing to do. I've warned him to keep an eye on
the little lady. I'll look in again after dinner. Good-by.
Better find a room and get some sleep if you can."</p>

<p>There was little doubt that Miss Goucher's turn for the
worse had come as the result of Susan's disturbing all-night
absence. Susan had made her comfortable and left
her in bed, promising to be home before twelve. Miss
Goucher had fallen asleep about eleven and had not waked
until two. The light she had left for Susan had not been
switched off, and Susan's bed, which stood beside her own,
was unoccupied. Feverish from her bronchial cold, she
was at once greatly alarmed, and sprang from her bed to
go into the sitting-room, half hoping to find Susan there
and scold her a little for remaining up so late over her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
work. She did not even stop to put on a dressing-gown or
find her slippers. All this Susan later learned from her
red-eyed landlady, Miss O'Neill, whose own bedroom, as it
happened, was just beside their own. Miss O'Neill, a
meritorious if tiresome spinster of no particular age, had at
last been waked from heavy and well-earned sleep by persistent
knocking at her door. She had found Miss Goucher
standing in the unheated, draughty hall, bare-footed, in
her nightgown, her cheeks flushed with mounting fever
while her teeth chattered with cold.</p>

<p>Like a sensible woman she had hurried her instantly
back to bed, and would have gone at once for a hot-water
bottle, if Miss Goucher had not insisted upon a hearing.
Miss O'Neill was abjectly fond of Miss Goucher, who had
the rare gift of listening to voluble commonplace without
impatience&mdash;a form of sympathy so rare and so flattering
to Miss O'Neill's so often bruised self-esteem that she
would gladly&mdash;had there been any necessity&mdash;have carried
Miss Goucher rent-free for the mere spiritual solace of
pouring out her not very romantic troubles to her. She
had taken, Susan felt, an almost voluptuous pleasure in
this, her one opportunity to do something for Miss Goucher.
She had telephoned Gertrude's apartment for her: "no
matter if it is late! I won't have you upset like this for
nobody! They've got to answer!" And she had talked
with some man&mdash;"and I didn't like his tone, neither"&mdash;who
had asked her some rather odd questions, and had
then told her Miss Blake was O. K., not to worry about
Miss Blake; she'd had a fainting-spell and been put to bed;
she'd be all right in the morning; sure; well, he was the
doctor, he guessed he ought to know! "Queer kind of
doctor for a lady," Miss O'Neill had opined; "he sounded
more like a mick!" A shrewd guess, for he was, no doubt,
one of Conlon's trusties.</p>

<p>Miss Goucher had then insisted that she was going to
dress and go up at once to Susan, and had even begun her
preparations in spite of every protest, when she was seized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
with so stabbing a pain in her chest that she could only
collapse groaning on the bed and let Miss O'Neill minister
to her as best she might with water bottles and a mustard
plaster borrowed from Number Twelve.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>By the time I had tardily remembered to telephone Miss
Goucher it was almost nine <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, and it was Miss O'Neill
who had answered the call, receiving my assurances of
Susan's well-being, and informing me in turn that poor
Miss Goucher was good and sick and no mistake, let alone
worrying, and should she send for a doctor? She was a
Scientist herself, though she'd tried a mustard plaster,
anyway, always liking to be on the safe side; but Miss
Goucher wasn't, and so maybe she ought. At this point I
had naturally taken charge.</p>

<p>And it was at this point in my long, often interrupted
relation to Phil and Jimmy that Phil took charge.</p>

<p>"You're going to bed, Hunt&mdash;and you're going now!
There's absolutely nothing further you can do this evening,
and if anything turns up Jimmy or I can attend to it.
You've been living on your nerves all day and you show
it, too plainly. We don't want another patient to-morrow.
Run out and get some veronal powders, Jimmy.
Thanks. No protests, old man. You're going to bed!"</p>

<p>I went; and, drugged with veronal, I slept&mdash;slept dreamlessly&mdash;for
fourteen hours. When I woke, a little past ten,
Jimmy was standing beside me.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Hunt. You look rested up some!
How about breakfast?" His greeting went through all
the sounds and motions of cheerfulness, but it was counterfeit
coin. There was something too obviously wrong with
Jimmy's ordinarily fresh healthy-boy face; it had gone
sallow and looked pincushiony round the eyes. I stared
at him dully, but could not recall anything that might
account for this alteration. Only very gradually a faint
sense of discomfort began to pervade my consciousness.
Hadn't something happened&mdash;once&mdash;something rather sad&mdash;and
rather horrible? When was it? Where was I?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
And then the full gust of recollection came like a stiff
physical blow over my heart. I sat up with a sharp gasp
for breath.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"Well!" I demanded. "Miss Goucher! How is she?"</p>

<p>"She's dead, sir," answered Jimmy, turning away.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She's wonderful!" answered Jimmy.</p>

<p>He had not needed Susan's name.</p>

<p>Yes, in a sense, Jimmy was right. He was not a boy to
look far beneath the surface effects of life, and throughout
the following weeks Susan's surface effect was indeed wonderful.
Apparently she stood up to her grief and mastered
it, developing an outer stillness, a quietude strangely disquieting
to Phil and to me. Gentleness itself in word and
deed, for the first time since we had known her she became
spiritually reticent, holding from us her deeper thoughts.
It was as if she had secretly determined&mdash;God knows from
what pressure of lonely sorrow&mdash;to conventionalize her life,
to present the world hereafter nothing but an even surface
of unobtrusive conformity. This, we feared, was hereafter
to be her wounded soul's protection, her Chinese Wall. It
had not somehow the feel of a passing mood; it had rather
the feel of a permanent decision or renunciation. And it
troubled our hearts.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I spare you Gertrude's funeral, and Miss Goucher's.
The latter, held in a small, depressingly official mortuary
chapel, provided&mdash;at a price&mdash;by the undertaker, was
attended only by Phil, Jimmy, Susan, Sonia, Miss O'Neill
and me. Oh&mdash;there was also the Episcopal clergyman,
whom I provided. He read the burial service professionally,
but well; it is difficult to read it badly. There are a
few sequences of words that really are foolproof, carrying
their own atmosphere and dignity with them.</p>

<p>Phil and I, at Susan's request, had examined Miss
Goucher's effects and had made certain inquiries. She
had been for many years, we found, entirely alone in the
world&mdash;a phrase often, but seldom accurately, used. It is a
rare thing, happily, to discover a human being who is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
absolutely the last member of his or her family line; in
Miss Goucher's case this aloneness was complete. But so
far as her nonexistent ancestors were concerned, Miss
Goucher, we ascertained, had every qualification necessary
for a D. A. R.; forebears of hers had lived for generations
in an old homestead near Poughkeepsie, and the original
Ithiel Goucher had fought as a young officer under Washington.
From soldiering, the Gouchers had passed on to
farming, to saving souls, to school-teaching, to patent-medicine
peddling, and finally to drink and drugs and
general desuetude. Miss Goucher herself had been a last
flare-up of the primitive family virtues, and with her they
were now extinct.</p>

<p>All this we learned from her papers, and from an old
lady in Poughkeepsie who remembered her grandfather,
and so presumably her mother and father as well&mdash;though
in reply to my letter of inquiry she forbore to mention
them. They were mentioned several times in letters and
legal documents preserved by Miss Goucher, but&mdash;except to
say that they both died before she was sixteen&mdash;I shall
follow the example of the old lady in Poughkeepsie. She,
I feel, and the Roman poet long before her, had what
Jimmy calls the "right idea."&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Miss Goucher, always methodical, left a brief and characteristic
will: "To Susan Blake, ward of Ambrose Hunt,
Esq., of New Haven, Conn., and to her heirs and assigns
forever, I leave what little personal property I possess.
She has been to me more than a daughter. I desire to be
cremated, believing that to be the cleanest and least troublesome
method of disposing of the dead."</p>

<p>That, with the proper legal additions, was all. Her
desire was of course respected, and I had a small earthenware
jar containing her ashes placed in my own family
vault. On this jar Susan had had the following words
inscribed:</p>

<div class='bbox'><div class='center'>
MALVINA GOUCHER<br />
A GENTLE WOMAN<br /></div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>On one point Susan was from the first determined:
Miss Goucher's death should make no difference in her
struggle for independence; she would go on as she had
begun, and fight things through to a finish alone. Neither
Phil nor I could persuade her to take even a few days for
a complete change of scene, a period of rest and recuperation.
Simply, she would not. She settled down at once to
work harder than ever, turning out quotable paragraphs
for <i>Whim</i>, as daring as they were sprightly; and she resolutely
kept her black hours of loneliness to herself. That
she had many such hours I then suspected and now know,
but on my frequent visits to New York&mdash;I had been
appointed administrator of Miss Goucher's more than modest
estate&mdash;she ignored them, and skillfully turned all my
inquiries aside. These weeks following on Miss Goucher's
death were for many reasons the unhappiest of my life.</p>

<p>Never since I had known Susan, never until now, had
our minds met otherwise than candidly and freely. Now,
through no crying fault on either side&mdash;unless through a
lack of imagination on mine&mdash;barriers were getting piled
up between us, barriers composed of the subtlest, yet stubbornest
misunderstandings. Our occasional hours together
soon became a drab tissue of evasions and cross purposes
and suppressed desires. Only frankness can serve me here
or make plain all that was secretly at work to deform the
natural development of our lives.</p>

<p>There are plays&mdash;we have all attended them to our
indignation&mdash;in which some unhappy train of events seems
to have been irrationally forced upon his puppets by the
author; if he would only let them speak out freely and
sensibly, all their needless difficulties would vanish! Such
plays infuriate the public and are never successful.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" we exclaim. "Why didn't she <i>say</i> she
loved him in the first place!"&mdash;or, "If he had only told
her his reasons for leaving home that night!"</p>

<p>We, the enlightened public, feel that in the shoes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
either the hero or the heroine we must have acted more
wisely, and we refuse our sympathy to misfortunes that
need never have occurred. Our reaction is perhaps inevitable
and &aelig;sthetically justified; but I am wondering&mdash;I am
wondering whether two-thirds of the unhappiness of most
mortals is not due to their failure clearly to read another's
thoughts or clearly to reveal their own? Is not half, at
least, of the misery in our hearts born of futile misunderstandings,
misunderstandings with which any sane onlooker
in full possession of the facts on both sides, can have little
patience, since he instinctively feels they ought never to
have taken place? But it is only in the theater that we
find such an onlooker, the audience, miraculously in possession
of the facts on both sides. In active life, we are
doing pretty well if we can partly understand our own
motives; we are supermen if we divine the concealed,
genuine motives of another. Certainly at this period Susan,
with all her insight, did not seize my motives, nor was I
able to interpret hers. Hence, we could not speak out!
What needed to be said between us could not be said. And
the best proof that it could not is, after all, that it was
not.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The conversation that ought to have taken place between
us might not unreasonably have run something like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>: Ambo dear&mdash;what <i>is</i> the matter? Heaven knows
there's enough!&mdash;but I mean between <i>us?</i> You've never
been more wonderful to me than these past weeks&mdash;and
never so remote. I can feel you edging farther and farther
away. Why, dear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span>: I've been a nuisance to you too long, Susan. Whatever
I am from now on, I won't be that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>: As if you could be; or ever had been!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span>: Don't try to spare my feelings because you like me&mdash;because
you're grateful to me and sorry for me! I've had
a glimpse of fact, you see. It's the great moral antiseptic.
My illusions are done for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>: What illusions?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span>: The illusion that you ever have really loved me.
The illusion that you might some day grow to love me. The
illusion that you might some day be my wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>: Only the last is illusion, Ambo. I do love you.
I'm growing more in love with you every day. But I can't
be your wife, ever. If I've seemed changed and sad&mdash;apart
from Sister's death, and everything else that's happened&mdash;it's
<i>that</i>, dear. It's killing me by half-inches to know I can
never be completely part of your life&mdash;yours!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span>:</p>

<p>[But I can't even imagine what babble of sorrow and
joy such words must have wrung from me! Suppose a
decent interval, and a partial recovery of verbal control.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>: You shouldn't have rescued me from Birch
Street, Ambo. Everything's made it plain to me, at last.
But I've already ground the mud of it into your life now&mdash;in
spite of myself. You'll never feel really clean again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span>: What nonsense! Susan, Susan&mdash;dearest!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>: It isn't nonsense. You forget; I'm a specialist
in nonsense nowadays. Oh, Ambo, how can you care for
me! I've been so insufferably self-satisfied; so childishly
blind! My eyes are wide open now. I've had the whole
story of what happened that awful night&mdash;all of it&mdash;from
Doctor Askew. He thought he was psycho-analyzing me,
while I pumped it out of him, drop by drop. And I've
been to Maltby, too; yes, I've been to Maltby, behind your
back. Ambo, he isn't really certain yet that I didn't go
crazy that night and kill your wife. Neither, I'm sure, is
Mrs. Arthur. They've given me the benefit of the doubt
simply because they dread being dragged through a horrible
scandal, that's all. But they're not convinced. Of
course, Maltby didn't say so in so many words, but it was
plain as plain! He was afraid of me&mdash;afraid! I could
feel his fear. He thinks madness is in my blood. Well,
he's right. Not just as he means it, but as <i>Setebos</i> means
it&mdash;the cruel, jealous God of this world!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, wait,
dear! Let me say it out to you, once for all. My father
ended a brutal life by an insanely brutal murder, then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
killed himself; my own father. And I've never all these
years honestly realized that as part of my life&mdash;part of <i>me!</i>
But now I do. It's there, back of me. I can never escape
from it. Oh, how could I have imagined myself like others&mdash;a
woman like others, free to love and marry and have
children and a home! How could I!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span>: Susan! Is that all? Is it really all that's holding
you from me? Good God, dear! Why, I thought you&mdash;secretly&mdash;perhaps
even unknown to yourself&mdash;loved
Jimmy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>: Jimmy? You thought&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span>: I think so even now. How can I help it? Look.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
[And here you must suppose me to show her those first
scrawled sheets, written automatically by her hand.] Perhaps
I'm revealing your own heart to you, Susan&mdash;dragging
to light what you've tried to keep hidden even from yourself.
See, dear. "A net. No means of escape from it.
To escape&mdash;somehow. Jimmy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>[And then Susan would perhaps have handed back those
scrawled pages to me with a pitying and pitiful smile.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span>:</p>

<p>[<i>Author's Note:</i> This carefully written, imaginary
speech has been deleted <i>in toto</i> by Censor Susan from the
page proof&mdash;at considerable expense to me&mdash;and the following
authentic confession substituted for it in her own
hand. But she doesn't know I am making this explanation,
which will account to you for the form and manner of her
confession, purposely designed to be a continuation of my
own imaginary flight. In admitting this, I am risking
Susan's displeasure; but conscience forbids me to let you
mistake a "genuine human document"&mdash;so dear to the
modern heart&mdash;for a mere effort at interpretation by an
amateur psychologist. What follows, then, is veracious, is
essentially that solemn thing so dear to a truth-loving
generation&mdash;sheer <i>fact</i>.]</p>

<p>Ambo dear, I can explain that, but not without a long,
unhappy confession. Must I? It's a shadowy, inside-of-me
story, awfully mixed and muddled; not a nice story<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
at all. Won't it be better, all round, if I simply say again
that I love <i>you</i>, not Jimmy, with all my heart?</p>

<p>[No doubt I should then have reached for her hands,
and she would have drawn away.]</p>

<p>Ah, no, dear, please not! I've never made a clean breast
of it all, even to myself. It's got to be done, though, Ambo,
sooner or later, for both our sakes. Be patient with me.
I'll begin at the beginning.</p>

<p>I'm ridiculously young, Ambo; we all keep forgetting
how young I am! I'm an infant prodigy, really; you and
Phil&mdash;and God first, I suppose&mdash;have made me so. And
the main point about infant prodigies is that experience
hasn't caught up with them. They live in things they've
imagined from things they've been told or read, live on
intuition and second-hand ideas; and they've no means of
testing their real values in a real world. And they're childishly
conceited, Ambo! I am. Less now than some months
ago; but I'm still pretty bad.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Well, back in Birch Street, before I came to you, when
I was honestly a child, I lived all alone inside of myself.
I lived chiefly on stories I made up about myself; and of
course my stories were all escapes from reality&mdash;from the
things that hurt or disgusted me most. There was hardly
anything in my life at home that I didn't long to escape
from. You can understand that, in a general way. But
there's one thing you perhaps haven't thought about; it's
such an ugly thing to think about. I know it isn't modern
of me, but I do hate to talk about it, even to you. I must,
though. You'll never understand&mdash;oh, lots of later things&mdash;unless
I do.</p>

<p>Love, Ambo, human love, as I learned of it there at
home&mdash;and I saw and heard much too much of it&mdash;frightened
and sickened me. It was swinish&mdash;horrible. Most of
all I longed to escape from all that! I couldn't. I wonder
if anyone ever has or can? We are made as we are made.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Yes, I longed to escape from it; but my very made-up
story of escape was a disguised romance. Jimmy was to be
the gentle Galahad who would some day rescue me. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
had done battle for me once already&mdash;with Joe Gonfarone.
But some day he would come in white, shining armor and
take me far away from all the mud and sweat of Birch
Street to blue distant hills. Artemis was all mixed up in
it, too; she was to be our special goddess; our free, swift,
cool-eyed protector. There was to be no heartsick shame,
no stuffiness in my life any more forever! But it wasn't
Jimmy who rescued me, Ambo. You did.</p>

<p>Only, when we've lived in a dream, wholly, for months
and months and months, it doesn't vanish, Ambo; it never
vanishes altogether; it's part of us&mdash;part of our lives.
Isn't it? Gertrude was once your dream, dear; and the
dream-Gertrude has never really vanished from your life,
and never will. Ah, don't I know!</p>

<p>Well, then you rescued me; and you and Phil and Maltby
and Sister and books and Hillhouse Avenue and France
and Italy and England, and my Magic Circle&mdash;<i>everything</i>&mdash;crowded
upon me and changed me and made me what
I am; if I'm anything at all! But Birch Street had made
me first; and my dreams.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Ambo, I can never make you know what you've been
to me, never! Cinderella's prince was nothing beside you,
and my Galahad-Jimmy a pale phantom! I shan't try.
And I can never make you know what a wild confusion
of storm you sent whirling through me when I first felt the
difference in you&mdash;felt your man's need of me, of <i>me</i>, body
and soul! You meant me not to feel that, Ambo; but I
did. I was only seventeen. And my first reaction was all
passionate joy, a turbulent desire to give, give, give&mdash;and
damn the consequences! It was, Ambo. I loved you.</p>

<p>But given you and me, Ambo, that couldn't last long.
You're too moral&mdash;and I'm too complicated. My inner pattern's
a labyrinth, full of queer magic; simple emotions
soon get lost in me, lost and transformed. And please don't
keep forgetting how young I was, and still am; how little
I could understand of all I was conceited enough to think
I understood! Well, dear, I saw you struggling to suppress
your love for me as something wrong, unworthy;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
something that could only harm us both. And then all that
first, swift, instinctive joy went out of me, and my old
fear and distrust of what men call love seized me again.
"Stuffiness, stuffiness everywhere&mdash;it leads to nothing but
stuffiness!" I said. "I hate it. I won't let it rule my life.
The great thing is to keep clear of it, clean of it, aloof
and free!" The old Artemis-motive swept through me
again like a hill-wind&mdash;but it came in gusts; and there
were days&mdash;weeks, Ambo&mdash;when I simply wanted to be
yours. And one night I threw myself into your arms.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>But the next day I was afraid again. The phrase "passion's
slave" got into my head and plagued me. Then you
came to me and said, "It's the end of the road, dear. We
can't go on." That changed everything once more, Ambo,
in a flash. That was my crisis. From that moment, I was
madly jealous of Gertrude; knew I always had been, from
the first. My telegram to her was a challenge to battle.
It was, dear&mdash;and I lost. She came back; she was wonderful,
too&mdash;her way&mdash;and the old Gertrude-dream stirred
in you again; just stirred, but that was enough. You said
to yourself, didn't you? that perhaps after all the best solution
for our wretched difficulties was for Gertrude to return
to her home. At least, that would end things. But
you couldn't have said that to yourself if Gertrude had
been really repulsive to you. The old dream had fluttered
its tired wings, once, Ambo; you know it had!</p>

<p>And so I flopped again, dear! I was sick of love; I hated
love! I said to myself, "I won't have this stupid, brutal,
instinctive thing pushing and pulling me about like this!
I'll rule my own life, thanks&mdash;my own thoughts and
dreams! <i>Freedom's</i> the thing&mdash;the only good thing in life.
I'll be free! Ambo, too, must learn to be free. We can
only share what's honestly best in both of us when at last
we are free!"</p>

<p>My Galahad-Jimmy had turned up again, too. Perhaps
that had something to do with my final fiercest revolt
against you. I don't know. He was all I had wanted him
to be, Ambo; simple and straightforward and clean. Oh,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
he had his white, shining armor on, bless him! But I
didn't want him to rescue me, for all that; not in the old
way. I was just glad my dream-boy had come a little
true; that's all. You were jealous of him, weren't you?
Confess! You needn't have been.</p>

<p>But here in New York, with Sister, things happened
that made a difference.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>First of all, dear, I discovered all I had lost in losing
you; discovered I <i>couldn't</i> be free. All I could do was to
make some kind of a life of it; for Sister, chiefly. And I
tried; oh, I did try! Then those whispered scandals about
us began. But it wasn't the scandal itself that did for me;
it was something added to it&mdash;by Mrs. Arthur, I suppose&mdash;something
<i>true</i>, Ambo, that I'd never honestly faced. Suddenly
my father rose from the dead! Suddenly I was
forced to feel that never, never under any conditions, would
it have been possible for me to be yours&mdash;bear you children.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Suddenly I felt, saw&mdash;as I should have seen long
ago&mdash;that the strain of evil, perhaps of madness, in my
father&mdash;the strain that made his life a hell of black passions&mdash;must
end with me!</p>

<p>Here's where Jimmy comes back, Ambo&mdash;and it's the
worst of all I have to confess. My anxiety was all for you
now: not for myself, I happened to love you that way.
"Suppose," I kept thinking, "suppose something should
unexpectedly make it possible for Ambo to ask me to be
his wife? Suppose Gertrude should fall in love herself
and insist on divorce? Or suppose she should die? Ambo
would be certain to come to me. And if he did? Should
I have the moral courage to send him away? As I must&mdash;I
must!"</p>

<p>Dear, from that time on a sort of demon in me kept
suggesting: "Jimmy&mdash;Jimmy's the solution! He's almost
in love with you now; all he needs is a little encouragement.
You could manage it, Susan. You could engage yourself
to Jimmy; and then you could string him along! You
could make it an interminable engagement, years and
years of it, and break it off when Ambo was thoroughly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
discouraged or cured; you're clever enough for that. And
Jimmy's ingenuousness itself. You could manage Jimmy."
Oh, please don't think I ever really listened to my demon,
was ever tempted by him! But I hated myself for the
mere fact that such thoughts could even occur to me!
They did, though, more than once; and each time I had to
banish them, thrust them down into their native darkness.</p>

<p>But they didn't die there, Ambo; they lived there, a hideous
secret life, lying in wait to betray me. They never
will betray me, of course; I loathe them. But they can still
stir in their darkness, make themselves known. That's
what the references to Jimmy mean, Ambo, in those pages
I scribbled in my trance; and that's <i>all</i> they mean. For
I don't love him; I love you.</p>

<p>But I can't marry you, ever. I can't. That black
strain concentrated in my father&mdash;oh, it must die out with
me! Just as Sister's line ended with her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She ran
away from the one love of her life, Ambo&mdash;just as I must
run away from you. You never knew that about Sister.
But I knew it. Sonia told me. Sister told <i>her</i>, the week
before Sonia married. Sister felt then that Sonia ought to
run away from all that, as she had. But Sonia wouldn't
listen to her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p></div>

<p>"Good for Sonia!" I might then have cried out. "God
bless her! Hasn't she made her husband happy? Aren't
her children his pride? Why in heaven's name should
she have denied herself the right to live! And for a mere
possibility of evil! As if the blood of any human family on
earth were wholly sound, wholly blameless! Sonia was
selfish, but right, dear; and Miss Goucher was brave, but
wrong! So are you wrong! Actually inherited feeble-mindedness,
or insanity, or disease&mdash;that's one thing; but
a dread of mere future possibilities, of mere supposed tendencies!
Good Lord! The human race might as well
commit suicide <i>en bloc!</i> It's you I love&mdash;<i>you</i>&mdash;just as you
are. And you say you love me. Well, that settles it!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>But who knows? It might have settled it and it might
not&mdash;could any such imaginary conversation conceivably
have taken place. It did not take place. We are dealing,
worse luck, with history.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Perhaps six weeks after Miss Goucher's death one little
conversation, just skirting these hidden matters, did take
place between us; but how different was its atmosphere, and
how drearily different its conclusion! You will understand
it better now that&mdash;like a theater audience, or like
God&mdash;you are in full possession of Susan's facts and of
mine; but I fear it will interest you less. To know all
may sometimes be to forgive all; but more often, alas, it
is to be bored by everything.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>[Firmly inserted note, by Susan: "Rubbish! It's only
when we <i>think</i> we know it all, and don't really, that we
are bored."]</p>

<p>I had taken Susan for dinner that night to a quiet hotel
uptown where I knew the dining-room, mercifully lacking
an orchestra and a cabaret, was not well patronized, though
the cooking was exceptionally good. At this hotel, by a
proper manipulation of the head waiter, it is often possible
to get a table a little apart from the other diners&mdash;an advantage,
if one desires to talk intimately without the annoyance
of being overheard. It troubled me to find Susan's
appetite practically nonexistent; I had ordered one or
two special dishes to tempt her, but I saw that she took
no pleasure in them, merely forcing herself to eat so as
not to disquiet me. She was looking badly, too, all gleamless
shadow, and fighting off a physical and mental languor
by a stubborn effort which she might have concealed from
another, but not from me. It was only too plain to me that
her wish was to keep the conversation safely away from
whatever was busying and saddening her private thoughts.
In this, till the coffee was placed before us, I thought best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
to humor her, and we had discussed at great length the
proper format for her first book of poems, which was to
appear within the next month. Also, we had discussed
Heywood Sampson's now rapidly maturing plans for his
new critical review.</p>

<p>"He really wants me on his staff, Ambo, and I really
want to be on it&mdash;just for the pleasure of working with
him. It's an absolutely unbelievable chance for me! And
yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And yet&mdash;&mdash;? Is there any reason why you shouldn't
accept?"</p>

<p>"At least two reasons, yes. I'm afraid both of them will
surprise you."</p>

<p>"I wonder."</p>

<p>"Won't they? If not, Ambo, you must suppose you've
guessed them. What are they?"</p>

<p>Susan rather had me here. I had not guessed them, but
wasn't willing to admit even to myself that I could not if
I tried. I puckered my brows, judicially.</p>

<p>"Well," I hesitated, "you may very naturally feel that
'Dax' is too plump a bird in the hand to be sacrificed
for Heywood's slim bluebird in the bush. Any new publication's
a gamble, of course. On the other hand, Heywood
isn't the kind to leave his associates high and dry. Even
if the review should fail, he'll stand by you somehow. He
has a comfy fortune, you know; he could carry on the review
as a personal hobby if he cares to, even if it never
cleared a penny."</p>

<p>Susan smiled, gravely shaking her head: "Cold, dear;
stone cold. I'm pretty mercenary these days, but I'm not
quite so mercenary as that. Now that I've discovered I
can make a living, I'm not nearly so interested in it; hardly
at all. It's the stupid side of life, always; I shouldn't
like it to make much difference to me now, when it comes
to real decisions. I did want a nice home for Sister, though.
As for me, any old room most anywhere will do. It will,
Ambo; don't laugh; I'm in earnest. But what's your
second guess?" she added quickly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"You've some writing you want to do&mdash;a book, maybe?
You're afraid the review will interfere?"</p>

<p>"Ah, now you're a tiny bit warmer! I am afraid it will
interfere, but in a much deeper way than that; interfere
with <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"I don't quite follow that, do I!"</p>

<p>"Good gracious, no&mdash;since you ask. It's simple enough,
though&mdash;and pretty vague. Only it feels important&mdash;here."
For an instant her hand just touched her breast.
"I hate so to be roped in, Ambo, have things staked out
for me&mdash;spiritually, I mean. Mr. Sampson's a darling; I
love him! But he's a great believer in ropes and stakes
and fences&mdash;even barbed wire. I'm beginning to see that
the whole idea of his review is a scheme for mending political
and moral and social fences, stopping up gaps in them
made by irresponsible idealists&mdash;anarchists, revolutionary
socialists&mdash;people like that. People like me, really!&mdash;There!
Now you do look surprised."</p>

<p>I was; but I smiled.</p>

<p>"You've turned <i>Red</i>, Susan? How long since? Overnight?"</p>

<p>"Not red," answered Susan, with bravely forced gayety;
"pinkish, say! I haven't fixed on my special shade till
I'm sure it becomes me."</p>

<p>"It's certain to do that, dear."</p>

<p>She bobbed me a little bow across the cloth, much in the
old happy style&mdash;alas, not quite. "But I never did like
washed-out colors," she threw in for good measure.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> irresponsible, then! Suppose Phil could hear
you&mdash;or Jimmy. Jimmy'd say your Greenwich Village
friends were corrupting you. Perhaps they are?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps they are," echoed Susan, "but I think not.
I'm afraid it goes farther back, Ambo. It's left-over
Birch Street; that's what it is. So much of me's that.
All of me, I sometimes believe."</p>

<p>"Not quite. You'll never escape Hillhouse, either,
Susan. You've had both."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I've had both," she echoed again, almost on a
sigh, pushing her untasted <i>demi-tasse</i> from her.</p>

<p>Suddenly her elbows were planted on the cloth before
her, her face&mdash;shadowed and too finely drawn&mdash;dropped
between her hands, her eyes sought and held mine. They
dizzied me, her eyes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"Ambo," she said earnestly, "I suppose I'm a dreadful
egotist, but more and more I'm feeling the real me isn't
a true child of this world! I love this world&mdash;and I hate
it. I don't know whether I love it most or hate it most.
I bless it and damn it every day of my life&mdash;in the same
breath often. But sometimes I feel I hate it most&mdash;hate it
for its cold dullness of head and heart! Why can't we
care more to make it worth living in, this beautiful, frightful
world! What's the matter with us? Why are we
what we are? Half angels&mdash;and half pigs or goats or saber-toothed
tigers or snakes! Each and every one of us, by
and large! And oh, how we do distrust our three-quarters
angels&mdash;while they're living, anyway! Dreamers&mdash;mad
visionaries&mdash;social rebels&mdash;outcasts! Crucify them, crucify
them! Time enough to worship them&mdash;ages of to-be-wasted
time enough&mdash;when they're dead!" She paused, still holding
my eyes, and drawing in a slow breath, a breath that
caught midway and was almost a sob; then her eyes left
mine.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;that's over. Saying things like that doesn't
help us a bit; it's&mdash;silly.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And half the idealists <i>are</i>
mad, no doubt, and have plenty of pig and snake in them,
too. I've simply coils and coils of unregenerate serpent
in me&mdash;and worse. Oh, Ambo dear&mdash;but I've a dream in
me beyond all that, and a great longing to help it come
true! But it doesn't&mdash;it won't. I'm afraid it never will&mdash;here.
Will it <i>there</i>, Ambo? Is there a <i>there?</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Have
we got all of Sister that clean fire couldn't take, shut up in
that tiny vase?"</p>

<p>"We can hope not, at least," I replied.</p>

<p>"Hope isn't enough," said Susan. "Why don't you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
say you know we haven't! I know we haven't. I do
know it. It's the only thing I&mdash;<i>know!</i>"</p>

<p>A nervous waiter sidled up to us and softly slipped a
small metal tray before me; it held my bill, carefully
turned face downward.</p>

<p>"Anything more, sir?" he murmured.</p>

<p>"A liqueur?" I suggested to Susan. She sat upright
in her chair again, with a slight impatient shake of the
head.</p>

<p>I ordered a cigar and a <i>fine champagne</i>. The waiter,
still nervously fearful of having approached us at a moment
when he suspected some intimate question of the heart
had grown critically tense, faded from us with the slightest,
discreetest cough of reassurance. He was not one, he
would have us know, to obtrude material considerations
when they were out of place.</p>

<p>"No; I can't go with Mr. Sampson," Susan was saying;
"and he'll be hurt&mdash;he won't be able to see why. But
I'm not made to be an editor&mdash;of anything. Editors have
to weigh other people's words. I can't even weigh my own.
And I talk of nothing but myself. Ugh!"</p>

<p>"You're tired out, overwrought," I stupidly began.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me so!" cried Susan. "If I should believe
you, I'd be lost."</p>

<p>"But," I blundered on, "it's only common sense to let
down a little, at such a time. If you'd only take a real
rest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no such thing," said Susan. "We just struggle
on and on. It's rather awful, isn't it?" And presently,
very quietly, as if to herself, she said over those
words, surely among the saddest and loveliest ever written
by mortal man:</p>

<div class='poem'>
<i>From too much love of living,</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>From hope and fear set free,</i></span><br />
<i>We thank with brief thanksgiving</i><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Whatever gods may be</i></span><br />

</div>

<p>"To sea," she repeated; "to sea.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As if the sea itself
knew rest!&mdash;Now please pay your big fat bill from your
nice fat pocketbook, Ambo; and take me home."</p>

<p>"If I only could!" was my despairing thought; and I
astounded the coat-room boy, as I tipped him, by muttering
aloud, "Oh, damn Jimmy Kane!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;thank you, sir&mdash;I will, sir," grinned the
coat-room boy.</p>

<p>On our way downtown in the taxi Susan withdrew until
we reached her West Tenth Street door. "Good-night,
Ambo," she then said; "don't come with me; and thank
you for everything&mdash;always." I crossed the pavement with
her to the loutish brownstone front-stoop of the boarding
house; there she turned to dismiss me.</p>

<p>"You didn't ask my second reason for not going on the
review, Ambo. You must know it though, sooner or later.
I can't <i>write</i> any more&mdash;not well, I mean. Even my Dax
paragraphs are falling off; Hadow Bury mentioned it yesterday.
But nothing comes. I'm sterile, Ambo. I'm written
out at twenty. Bless you. Good-night."</p>

<p>"Susan," I cried, "come back here at once!" But she
just turned in the doorway to smile back at me, waved her
hand, and was gone.</p>

<p>I was of two minds whether to follow her or stay. Then,
"A whim," I thought; "the whim of a tired child. And
I've often felt that way myself&mdash;all writers do. But she
must take a vacation of some kind&mdash;she must!"</p>

<p>She did.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>I woke up the next morning, broad awake before seven
o'clock, a full hour earlier than my habit. I woke to find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
myself greatly troubled by Susan's parting words of the
night before, and lay in bed for perhaps twenty minutes
turning them over fretfully in my mind. Then I could
stand it no longer and rose, bathed, dressed and ate my
breakfast in self-exasperating haste, yet with no very clear
idea of why I was hurrying or what was to follow. I
had an appointment with my lawyer for eleven; I was to
lunch with Heywood Sampson at one; after lunch&mdash;my immediate
business in town being completed&mdash;I had purposed
to return to New Haven.</p>

<p>Susan would be expecting me for my daily morning call
at half-past nine. That call was a fixed custom between us
when I was stopping in New York. It seldom lasted over
twenty minutes and was really just an opportunity to say
good-morning and arrange conveniently for any further
plans for the day or evening. But it was now only a few
minutes past eight. No matter, Susan was both a nighthawk
and a lark, retiring always too late and rising too
early&mdash;though it must be said she seemed to need little
sleep; and I felt that I must see her at once and try somehow
to encourage her about her work and bring her back
to a more reasonable and normal point of view. "Overstrain,"
I kept mumbling to myself, idiotically enough,
as I charged rather than walked down Fifth Avenue from
my hotel: "Overstrain&mdash;overstrain.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>However, the brisk physical exertion of my walk gradually
quieted my nerves, and as I turned west on Tenth
Street I was beginning to feel a little ashamed of my unreasonable
anxiety, was even beginning to poke a little fun
at myself and preparing to amuse Susan if I could by
a whimsical account of my morning brainstorm. I had now
persuaded myself that I should find her quietly at work,
as I so usually did, and quite prepared to talk things over
more calmly. I meant this time to make a supreme effort,
and really hoped to persuade her to do two sensible things:
First, to accept Heywood Sampson's offer; second, to give
up all other work for the present, and get a complete rest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and change of scene until her services were needed for
the review. That would not be for six or eight weeks at
the very least.</p>

<p>And I at last had a plan for her. You may or may not
remember that Ashton Parker was a famous man thirty
years ago; they called him "Hyena Parker" in Wall Street,
and no doubt he deserved it; yet he faded gently out with
consumption like any spring poet, having turned theosophist
toward the end and made his peace with the Cosmic
Urge. Mrs. Ashton Parker is an aunt of mine, long a
widow, and a most delightful, easy-going, wide-awake,
and sympathetic old lady, who has made her home in Santa
Barbara ever since her husband's death there. Her Spanish
villa and gardens are famous, and her always kindly
eccentricities scarcely less famous than they. I could imagine
no one more certain to captivate Susan or to be instantly
captivated by her; and though I had not seen Aunt
Belle for more than ten years, I knew I could count
on her in advance to fall in with my plan. Her hospitality
is notorious and would long since have beggared
anyone with an income less absurd. Susan should go there
at once, for a month at least; the whole thing could be
arranged by telegraph. Why in heaven's name hadn't I
thought of and insisted upon this plan before!</p>

<p>Miss O'Neill, in person, opened the front door for me.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Hunt!" she wailed. "Thanks to goodness
you're here early. I can't do nothing with Togo. He
won't eat no breakfast, and he won't let nobody touch him.
He's sitting up there like a&mdash;I don't know what, with
his precious tail uncurled and his head sort of hanging
down&mdash;it'll break your heart to look at him! I can't bear
to myself, though I'd never no use for the beast, neither
liking nor disliking! He's above his station, I say. But
what with all&mdash;&mdash; And I've got to get that room cleared
and redone by twelve, feelings or no feelings, and Gawd
knows feelings <i>will</i> enter in! Not half Miss Susan's class
either, the new party just now applied, and right beside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
my own room, too, though well recommended, so I can't
complain!"</p>

<p>I broke through her dusty web of words with an impatient,
"What on earth are you talking about, Miss
O'Neill?"</p>

<p>"You don't know?" she gasped. "You don't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I most certainly do not. Where's Miss Susan?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Hunt! If I'd-a knowed she hadn't even spoke
to you! And you with her all evening&mdash;treating to dinner
and all! But thank Gawd it's a reel lady she went
away with! Miss Leslie, in her big limousine, that's often
been here! <i>That</i> I can swear to you with my own eyes!"</p>

<p>Susan was gone, and gone beyond hope of an immediate
return. There is no need to labor the details of her flight.
A letter, left for me with Miss O'Neill, gives all the surface
facts essential.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Dear Ambo:</i> Try not to be angry with me; or too hurt.
When I left you last night I decided to seize an opportunity
which had to be seized instantly, or not at all. Mona
Leslie has been planning for a long European sojourn all
winter, and for the past two weeks has been trying to persuade
me to go with her as a sort of overpaid companion
and private secretary. She has dangled a salary before me
out of all proportion to my possible value to her, but&mdash;never
feeling very sympathetic toward her sudden whims
and moods&mdash;that hasn't tempted me.</p>

<p>"Now, at the eleventh hour, literally, this chance for
a complete break with my whole past and probable future
has tempted me, and I've flopped. You've been
urging my need for rest and change; if that's what I do
need this will supply it, the change at least&mdash;with no sacrifice
of my hard-fought-for financial independence. It was
the abysmal prospect, as I came in, of having to go straight
to my room&mdash;with no Sister waiting for me&mdash;and beat my
poor typewriter and poorer brains for some sparks of wit&mdash;when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
I knew in advance there wasn't a spark left in me&mdash;that
sent me to the telephone.</p>

<p>"Now I'm packed&mdash;in half an hour&mdash;and waiting for
Mona. The boat sails about three <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>; I don't even know
her name: we'll be on her by midnight. Poor Miss O'Neill
is flabbergasted&mdash;and so I'm afraid will you be, and Phil
and Jimmy. I know it isn't kind of me simply to vanish
like this; but try to feel that I don't mean to be unkind.
Not even to Togo, though my treachery to him is villainous.
It will be a black mark against me in Peter's book
forever. But I can't take him, Ambo; I just can't. Please,
please&mdash;will <i>you?</i> You see, dear, I can't help being a
nuisance to you always, after all. And I can't even promise
you Togo will learn to love you, any more than Tumps&mdash;though
I hope he may. He'll grieve himself thin at
first. He knows something's in the air and he's grieving
beside me now. His eyes&mdash;&mdash; If Mona doesn't come soon,
I may collapse at his paws and promise him to stay.</p>

<p>"Mona talks of a year over there, from darkest Russia
to lightest France; possibly two. Her plans are characteristically
indefinite. She knows heaps of people all over,
of course. I'll write often. Please tell Hadow and Mr.
Sampson I'm a physical wreck&mdash;or mental, if it sounds
more convincing. I'm neither; but I'm tired&mdash;tired&mdash;<i>tired</i>.</p>

<p>"If you can possibly help Phil and Jimmy to understand&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here's Mona now. Good-by, dear.</p>

<p>"Your ashamed, utterly grateful</p>

<h2>THE SIXTH CHAPTER</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<div class='cap'>SO Togo and I went home. My misery craving company,
I rode with him all the way up in the baggage-car,
on the self-deceptive theory that he needed an everpresent
friend. It is true, however, that he did; and it
gratified me and a little cheered me that he seemed really
to appreciate my attentions. I sat on a trunk, lighting
each cigarette from the end of the last, and he sat at my
feet, leaned wearily against the calf of my right leg and
permitted me to fondle his ears.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</div>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>"Spring, the sweet spring!" Then birds do sing, hey-ding-a-ding&mdash;and
so on.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sweet lovers love the spring.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Jimmy, Phil and I saw little of each other those days.
Jimmy clouded his sunny brow and started in working
overtime. Phil plunged headlong into what was to have
proved his philosophical <i>magnum opus</i>&mdash;"The Pluralistic
Fallacy; a Critical Study of Pragmatism." I also plunged
headlong into a series of interpretative essays for Heywood
Sampson's forthcoming review. My first essay was to be
on Tolstoy; my second, on Nietzsche; my third, on Anatole
France; my fourth, on Samuel Butler and Bernard Shaw;
my fifth, on Thomas Hardy; and my sixth and last, on
Walt Whitman. From the works of these writers it was
my purpose to illustrate and clarify for the semicultured
the more significant intellectual and spiritual tendencies
of our enlightened and humane civilization. It is characteristic
that I supposed myself well equipped for this task.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
But I never got beyond my detached, urbane appreciation
of Nietzsche; just as I had concluded it&mdash;our enlightened
and humane civilization suddenly blew to atoms with a
<i>clich&eacute;</i>-shattering report and a vile stench as of too-long-imprisoned
gas.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>During those first months of Susan's absence, which for
more than four years were to prove the last months of
almost world-wide and wholly world-deceptive peace, several
things occurred of more or less importance to the present
history. They marked, for one thing, the auspicious
sprouting and rapid initial growth of Susan's literary
reputation. Her poems appeared little more than a month
after she had left us, a well-printed volume of less than
a hundred pages, in a sober green cover. I had taken a
lonely sort of joy in reading and rereading the proof; and
if even a split letter escaped me, it has not yet been brought
to my attention. These poems were issued under a quiet
title and an unobtrusive pen-name, slipping into the
market-place without any preliminary puffing, and I feared
they were of too fine a texture to attract the notice that I
felt they deserved. But in some respects, at least, Susan
was born under a lucky star. An unforeseen combination
of events suddenly focused public attention&mdash;just long
enough to send it into a third edition&mdash;upon this inconspicuous
little book.</p>

<p>Concurrently with its publication, <i>The Puppet Booth</i>
opened its doors&mdash;its door, rather&mdash;on Macdougal Street;
an artistic venture quite as marked, you would say, for
early oblivion as Susan's own. The cocoon of <i>The Puppet
Booth</i> was a small stable where a few Italian venders of
fruit and vegetables had kept their scarecrow horses and
shabby carts and handcarts. From this drab cocoon issued
a mailed and militant dragon-fly; vivid, flashing, erratic;
both ugly and beautiful&mdash;and wholly alive! For there
were in Greenwich Village&mdash;as there are, it would seem,
in all lesser villages, from Florida to Oregon&mdash;certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
mourners over and enthusiasts for the art called Drama,
which they believed to be virtually extinct. Shows, it is
true, hundreds of them, were each season produced on
Broadway, and some of these delighted hosts of the affluent,
sentimental, and child-like American <i>bourgeoisie</i>. Fortunate
managers, playsmiths and actors, endowed with
sympathy for the crude tastes of this <i>bourgeoisie</i>, a sympathy
partly instinctive and partly developed by commercial
acumen, waxed fat with a prosperity for which the
Village could not wearily enough express its contempt.</p>

<p>None of these creatures, said the Village&mdash;no, not one&mdash;was
a genuine artist! The Theater, they affirmed, had been
raped by the Philistines and prostituted to sophomoric
merrymakers by cynical greed. The Theater! Why, it
should be a temple, inviolably dedicated to its peculiar
god. Since the death of religion, it was perhaps the one
temple worthy of pious preservation. Only in a Theater,
sincerely consecrated to the great god, Art, could the enlightened,
the sophisticated, the free&mdash;unite to worship.
There only, they implied, could something adumbrating a
sacred ritual and a spiritual consolation be preserved.</p>

<p>Luckily for Susan, and indeed for us all&mdash;for we have
all been gainers from the spontaneous generation of "little
theaters" all over America, a phenomenon at its height just
previous to the war&mdash;one village enthusiast, Isidore Stalinski&mdash;by
vocation an accompanist, by avocation a vorticist,
by race and nature a publicist&mdash;had succeeded in mildly
infecting Mona Leslie&mdash;who took everything in the air,
though nothing severely&mdash;with offhand zeal for his cause.
The importance of her rather casual conversion lay in
the fact that her purse strings were perpetually untied.
Stalinski well knew that you cannot run even a tiny temple
for a handful of worshippers without vain oblations
on the side to the false gods of this world, and these
imply&mdash;oh, Art's desire!&mdash;a donor. And of all possible
varieties of donor, that most to be desired is the absentee
donor&mdash;the donor who donates as God sends rain, unseen.</p>

<p>At precisely the right moment Stalinski whispered to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Mona Leslie that <i>entre them</i>&mdash;though he didn't care to be
quoted&mdash;he preferred her interpretation of Faure's <i>Clair
de Lune</i> to that of &mdash;&mdash;, the particular <i>diva</i> he had just
been accompanying through a long, rapturously advertised
concert tour; and Mona Leslie, about to be off on her European
flight, became the absentee donor to <i>The Puppet
Booth</i>.</p>

<p>The small stable was leased and cleansed and sufficiently
reshaped to live up to its anxiously chosen name. Much
of the reshaping and all of the decorating was done, after
business hours, by the clever and pious hands of the villagers.
Then four one-act plays were selected from among
some hundreds poured forth by village genius to its rehabilitated
god. The clever and pious hands flew faster
than ever, busying themselves with scenery and costumes
and properties and color and lighting&mdash;all blended toward
the creation of a thoroughly uncommercial atmosphere.
And the four plays were staged, directed, acted, and finally
attended by the Village. It was a perfectly lovely party
and the pleasantest of times was had by all.</p>

<p>And it only remains to drop this tone of patronizing
persiflage and admit, with humblest honesty, that the first
night at <i>The Puppet Booth</i> was that very rare thing, a complete
success; what Broadway calls a "knockout." Within
a fortnight seats for <i>The Puppet Booth</i> were at a ruinous
premium in all the ticket agencies on or near Times Square.</p>

<p>I happened to be there on that ecstatic opening night.
Susan, in her first letter, from Liverpool, had enjoined me
to attend and report; Mona would be glad to learn from
an unprejudiced outsider how the affair went off. But
Susan did not mention the fact that one of the four selected
plays had been written by herself.</p>

<p>Jimmy was with me. Phil, who saw more of him than
I did, thought he was going stale from overwork, so I
had made a point of hunting him up and dragging him off
with me for a night in town. He hadn't wanted to go;
said frankly, he wasn't in the mood. I'm convinced it
was the first time he had ever used the word "mood" in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
connection with himself or anybody else. Jimmy and
moods of any kind simply didn't belong together.</p>

<p>We had a good man's dinner at a good man's chop-house
that night, and, once I got Jimmy to work on it,
his normal appetite revived and he engulfed oysters and
steak and a deep-dish apple pie and a mug or so of ale, with
mounting gusto. We talked, of course, of Susan.</p>

<p>Jimmy, inclined to a rosier view by comfortable repletion,
now maintained that perhaps after all Susan had done
the natural and sensible thing in joining Miss Leslie. He
emphasized all the obvious advantages&mdash;complete change of
environment, freedom from financial worry, and so on;
then he paused.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"And there's another point, Mr. Hunt," he began again,
doubtfully this time: "Prof. Farmer and I were talking
about it only the other day. We were wondering whether
we oughtn't to speak to you. But it's not the easiest thing
to speak of&mdash;it's so sort of vague&mdash;kind of a feeling in
the air."</p>

<p>I knew at once what he referred to, and nodded my head.
"So you and Phil have noticed it too!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you're <i>on</i> then? I'm glad of that, sir. You've
never mentioned anything, so Prof. Farmer and I couldn't
be sure. But it's got under our skins that it might make
a lot of trouble and something ought to be done about it.
It's hard to see what."</p>

<p>"Very," I agreed. "Fire ahead, Jimmy. Tell me exactly
what has come to you&mdash;to you, personally, I mean."</p>

<p>"Well," said Jimmy, leaning across the table to me
and lowering his voice, "it was all of three weeks ago.
I went to a dance at the Lawn Club. I don't dance very
well, but I figure a fellow ought to know how if he ever has
to, so I've slipped in a few lessons. I can keep off my partner's
feet, anyway. Well, Steve Putnam took me round
that night and introduced me to some girls. I guess if
they'd known my mother was living in New Haven and
married to a grocer, they wouldn't have had anything to
do with me. Maybe I ought to advertise the fact, but I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
don't&mdash;simply because I can't stand for my stepfather, and
so mother won't stand for me. Mother and I never could
get on, though; and it's funny, too&mdash;as a general rule I
can get on with 'most everybody. I told Prof. Farmer
the other night there must be something wrong with a
fellow who can't get on with his own mother&mdash;but he only
laughed. Of course, Mr. Hunt, I'm not exactly sailing
under false pretenses, either; if any girl wanted to make
real friends with me&mdash;I'd tell her all about myself
first."</p>

<p>"Of course," I murmured.</p>

<p>"And the same with men. Steve, for instance. He
knows all about me, and his father has a lot of money, but
he made it in soap&mdash;and Steve's from the West, anyway,
and don't care. Gee, I'm wandering&mdash;it's the ale, I guess,
Mr. Hunt; I'm not used to it. The point is. Steve introduced
me round, and I like girls all right, but Susan's
kind of spoiled me for the way most of them gabble.
I can't do that easy, quick-talk very good yet; Steve's
a bear at it. Well&mdash;I sat out a dance with one of the
girls, a Miss Simmons; pretty, too; but she's only a kid.
It was her idea, sitting out the dance in a corner&mdash;I
thought she didn't like the way I handled myself. But
that wasn't it. Mr. Hunt, she wanted to pump me; went
right at it, too.</p>

<p>"'You know Mr. Hunt awfully well, don't you?' she
asked; and after I'd said yes, and we'd sort of sparred
round a little, she suddenly got confidential, and a kind
of thrilled look came into her eyes, and then she asked
me straight out: 'Have you ever heard there was something&mdash;<i>mysterious</i>&mdash;about
poor Mrs. Hunt's death?'</p>

<p>"'No,' I said.</p>

<p>"'Haven't you!' she said, as much as to tell me she
knew, all the same, I must have. 'Why, Mr. Kane, it's all
over town. Nobody knows anything, but it's terribly exciting!
Some people think she committed suicide, all because
of that queer Miss Blake.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She must be&mdash;<i>you</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
know! And now she's run away to Europe! I believe she
was just afraid to stay over here, afraid she might be found
out or arrested&mdash;or something!'</p>

<p>"That's the way she went on, Mr. Hunt; and, well&mdash;naturally,
I pooh-poohed it and steered her off, and then
she lost interest in me right away. But she's right, Mr.
Hunt. There's a lot of that kind of whispered stuff in
the air, and I'm mighty glad Susan's off for a year or
two where she can't run into it. It'll all die out before
she's back again, of course."</p>

<p>"I hope so," was my reply; "but the source of these
rumors is very persistent&mdash;and very discreet. They start
from Mrs. Arthur; they must. But it's impossible to trace
them back to her. Jimmy, she means to make New Haven
impossible for me, and I've an idea she's likely to succeed.
Already, three or four old acquaintances have&mdash;well,
avoided me, and the general atmosphere's cooling pretty
rapidly toward zero. So far as I'm concerned, it doesn't
much matter; but it does matter for Susan. She may return
to find her whole future clouded by a settled impression
that in some way&mdash;indirectly&mdash;or even, directly&mdash;she
was responsible for my wife's sudden death."</p>

<p>"It's a damned outrage!" exclaimed Jimmy. "I don't
know Mrs. Arthur, but I'd like to wring her neck!"</p>

<p>"So would I, Jimmy; and she knows it. That's why
she's finding life these days so supremely worth living."</p>

<p>Jimmy pondered this. "Gee, I hate to think that badly
of any woman," he finally achieved; "but I guess it doesn't
do to be a fool and think they're all angels&mdash;like Susan.
Mother's not."</p>

<p>"No, Jimmy, it doesn't do," I responded. "Still, the
price for that kind of wisdom is always much higher than
it's worth."</p>

<p>"Women," began Jimmy&mdash;&mdash; But his aphorism somehow
escaped him; he decided to light a cigarette instead.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>And on this wave of cynicism I floated him off with me
to <i>The Puppet Booth</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>From the point of view of eccentric effectiveness and
<i>r&eacute;clame</i> wonders had been wrought with the small, ancient,
brick stable on Macdougal Street; but very little had been
or could be done for the comfort of its guests. The flat
exterior wall had been stuccoed and brilliantly frescoed
to suggest the entrance to some probably questionable
side-show at a French village fair; and a gay clown with
a drum, an adept at amusing local patter, had been stationed
before the door to emphasize the <i>funambulesque</i>
illusion. Within, this atmosphere&mdash;as of something gaudy
and transitory, the mere lath-and-canvas pitch of a vagabond
<i>banquiste</i>&mdash;had been cleverly carried out. The
cramped little theater itself struck one as mere scenery,
which was precisely the intention. There was clean sawdust
on the floor, and the spectators&mdash;one hundred of
them suffocatingly filled the hall&mdash;were provided only with
wooden benches, painted a vivid Paris green. These
benches had been thoughtfully selected, however, and were
less excruciating to sit on than you would suppose. There
was, naturally, no balcony; a false pitch-roof had been
constructed of rough stable beams, from which hung bannerets
in a crying, carefully studied dissonance of strong
color, worthy of the barbaric Bakst. The proscenium arch
was necessarily a toylike affair, copied, you would say,
from the <i>Guinol</i> in the Tuileries Gardens; and the curtain,
for a final touch, looked authentic&mdash;had almost certainly
been acquired, at some expenditure of thought and trouble,
from a traveling Elks' Carnival. There was even a false
set of footlights to complete the masquerade; a row of oil
lamps with tin reflectors. It was all very restless and
amusing&mdash;and extravagantly make-believe.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Jimmy and I arrived just in time to squeeze down the
single narrow side-aisle and into our places in the fourth
row. We had no opportunity to glance about us or consult
our broad-sheet programs, none to acquire the proper
mood of tense expectancy we later succumbed to, before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
lights were lowered and the curtain was rolled up in the
true antique style. "Gee!" muttered Jimmy, on my left,
with involuntary dislike. "Ah!" breathed a maiden, on
my right, with entirely voluntary rapture. Someone in the
front row giggled, probably a cub reporter doing duty that
evening as a dramatic critic; but he was silenced by a sharp
hiss from the rear.</p>

<p>The cause for these significant reactions was the <i>mise
en sc&egrave;ne</i> of the tiny vacant stage. It consisted of three
dead-black walls, a dead-black ceiling, and a dead-black
floor-cloth. In the back wall there was a high, narrow
crimson door with a black knob. A tall straight-legged
table and one straight high-backed chair, both lacquered
in crimson, were the only furniture, except for a slender
crimson-lacquered perch, down right, to which was chained
a yellow, green and crimson macaw. And through the
crimson door presently entered&mdash;undulated, rather&mdash;a personable
though poisonous young woman in a trailing robe
of vivid yellow and green.</p>

<p>The play that followed, happily a brief one, was called&mdash;as
Jimmy and I learned from our programs at its conclusion&mdash;"Polly."
It consisted of a monologue delivered
by the poisonous young woman to the macaw, occasionally
varied by <i>ad lib.</i> screams and chuckles from that evil white-eyed
bird. From the staccato remarks of the poisonous
young woman, we, the audience, were to deduce the erratic
eroticism of an <i>&acirc;me damn&eacute;e</i>. It was not particularly difficult
to do so, nor was it particularly entertaining. As a
little adventure in supercynicism, "Polly," in short, was
not particularly successful. It needed, and had not been
able to obtain, the boulevard wit of a Sacha Guitry to
carry it off. But the poisonous young woman had an
exquisitely proportioned figure, and her arms, bare to the
slight shoulder-straps, were quite faultless. Minor effects
of this kind have, even on Broadway, been known to save
more than one bad quarter hour from complete collapse.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
No, it was not the author's lines that carried us safely
through this first fifteen minutes of diluted Strindberg-Schnitzler!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
And the too deliberately bizarre <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i>,
though for a moment it piqued curiosity, had soon proved
wearisome, and we were glad&mdash;at least, Jimmy and I were&mdash;to
have it veiled from our eyes.</p>

<p>The curtain rolled down, nevertheless, to ecstatic cries
and stubbornly sustained applause. Raised lights revealed
an excited, chattering band of the faithful. The poisonous
young woman took four curtain calls and would seemingly,
from her parting gesture, have drawn us collectively to
her fine bosom with those faultless, unreluctant arms. And
the maiden on my right shuddered forth to her escort,
"I'm thrilled, darling! Feel them&mdash;feel my hands&mdash;they're
<i>moon-cold!</i> They always are, you know, when I'm
thrilled!"</p>

<p>"You can't beat this much, Mr. Hunt," whispered
Jimmy, on my left. "It's bughouse."</p>

<p>In a sense, it was; in a truer sense, it was not. A careful
analysis of the audience would, I was quickly convinced,
have disclosed not merely a saving remnant, but a saving
majority of honest workmen in the arts&mdash;men and women
too solidly endowed with brains and humor for any self-conscious
posing or public exhibition of temperament.
The genuine freaks among us were a scant handful; but
it is the special talent and purpose of your freak to&mdash;in
Whitman's phrase&mdash;"positively appear." Ten able freaks
to the hundred can turn any public gathering into a side
show; and the freaks of the Village, particularly the
females of the species, are nothing if not able. Minna
Freund, for example, who was sitting just in front of
Jimmy; it would be difficult for any assembly to obliterate
Minna Freund! She was, that night, exceptionally repulsive
in a sort of yellow silk wrapper, with her sparrow's
nest of bobbed Henner hair, and her long, bare, olive-green
neck, that so obviously needed to be scrubbed!</p>

<p>Having strung certain entirely unrelated words together
and called them "Portents," she had in those days acquired
a minor notoriety, and Susan&mdash;impishly enjoying my consequent
embarrassment&mdash;had once introduced me to her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
as an admirer of her work, at an exhibition of Cubist
sculpture. Minna was standing at the time, I recalled, before
Pannino's "Study of a Morbid Complex," and she
at once informed me that the morbid complex in question
had been studied from the life. She had posed her own
destiny for Pannino, so she assured me, at three separate
moments of psychic crisis, and the inevitable result had
been a masterpiece. "How it writhes!" she had exclaimed:
but to my uninstructed eyes Pannino's Study did anything
but writhe; it was stolidly passive; it looked precisely as
an ostrich egg on a pedestal would look if viewed in a
slightly convex mirror.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How far away all that stupid
nonsense seems!</p>

<p>And, suddenly, Jimmy leaped on the bench beside me
as if punctured by a pin: "Oh, good Lord, Mr. Hunt!"
he groaned. "Look here!"</p>

<p>He had thrust his program before me and was pointing
to the third play of the series with an unsteady finger.</p>

<p>"It's the same name," he whispered hoarsely; "the
one she's used for her book. Do you think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll soon find out," was my answer. "We must know
what we're in for, Jimmy!" And just as the lights were
lowered for the second play I rose, defying audible unpopularity,
and squeezed my way out to the door. That is why
I cannot describe for you the second play, a harsh little
tragedy of the sweatshops&mdash;"Horrible," Jimmy affirmed,
"but it kind of <i>got</i> me!"&mdash;written by an impecunious
young man with expensive tastes, who has since won the
means of gratifying them along Broadway by concocting
for that golden glade his innocently naughty librettos&mdash;"<i>Tra-la,
Th&eacute;r&egrave;se!</i>" and "<i>Oh, Mercy, Modestine!</i>"</p>

<p>Having sought and interviewed Stalinski&mdash;I found him
huddled in the tiny box-office, perspiring unpleasantly from
nervousness and many soaring emotions&mdash;I was back in my
seat, more unpopular than ever, in good time for Susan's&mdash;it
was unquestionably Susan's&mdash;play.</p>

<p>But most of you have read, or have seen, or have read
about, Susan's play.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the sensation of the evening, of many subsequent
evenings; and I have often wondered precisely why&mdash;for
there is in it nothing sensational. Its atmosphere is delicately
fantastic; remote, you would say, from the sympathies
of a matter-of-fact world, particularly as its fantasy
is not the highly sentimentalized make-believe of some
popular fairy tale. This fantasy of Susan's is ironic and
grave; simple in movement, too&mdash;just a few subtle modulations
on a single poignant theme. And I ask myself
wherein lies its throat-tightening quality, its irresistible
appeal? And I find but one answer; an answer which I
had always supposed, in my long intellectual snobbery, an
undeserved compliment to the human race; a compliment
no critic, who was not either dishonest or a fool, could
pay mankind.</p>

<p>But what other explanation can be given for the success
of Susan's play, both here and in England, than its
sheer <i>beauty?</i> Beauty of substance, of mood, of form, of
quiet, heart-searching phrase! It is not called "The Magic
Circle," but it might have been; for its magic is genuine,
distilled from the depths of Nature, and it casts an unescapable
spell&mdash;on poets and bankers, on publicans and
prostitutes and priests, on all and sundry, equally and
alike. It even casts its spell on those who act in it, and
no truer triumph can come to an author. I have never
seen it really badly played. Susan has never seen it played
at all.</p>

<p>On the first wave of this astonishing triumph, Susan's
pen-name was swept into the newspapers and critical
journals of America and England, and a piquant point
for gossip was added by the revelation that "Dax," who
for several months had so wittily enlivened the columns
of <i>Whim</i>, was one and the same person. Moreover, it was
soon bruited about that the author was a slip of a girl&mdash;radiantly
beautiful, of course; or why romance concerning
her!&mdash;and that there was something mysterious, even sinister,
in her history.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"A child of the underworld," said one metropolitan
journal, in its review of her poems. Popular legend presently
connected her, though vaguely, with the criminal
classes. I have heard an overdressed woman in a theater
lobby earnestly assuring another that she knew for a fact
that &mdash;&mdash; (Susan) had been born in a brothel&mdash;"one of
those houses, my dear"&mdash;and brought up&mdash;like Oliver
Twist, though the comparison escaped her&mdash;to be a thief.</p>

<p>And so it was that the public eye lighted for a little
hour on Susan's shy poems. Poetry was said to be looking
up in those days; and influential critics in their influential,
uninfluenced way suddenly boomed these, saying mostly
the wrong things about them, but saying them over and
over with energy and persistence. The first edition vanished
overnight; a larger second edition was printed and
sold out within a week or two; a still larger third edition
was launched and disposed of more slowly. Then came
the war.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>If I can say anything good of the war, it is this: Since
seemingly it must have come anyway, sooner or later, so
far as Susan is concerned it came just in time. A letter
from Phil to Susan, received toward the close of July,
1914, at the ch&acirc;teau of the Comtesse de Bligny, near Brussels,
will tell you why.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Dear Susan:</i> If the two or three notes I've sent you
previously have been brief and dull, I knew you would
make the inevitable allowances and forgive me. In the
first place, God didn't create me to scintillate, as you've
long had reason to know; and since you left us I've been
buried in a Sahara of work, living so retired a life in my
desert that little news comes my way. But Jimmy breaks
in on me, always welcomely, with an occasional bulletin,
and last night Hunt came over and we had a long evening
together. He's worried, Susan, not without great cause, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
fear; he looks tired and ill; and after mulling things over,
with my usual plodding caution&mdash;I've thought best to explain
the situation to you.</p>

<p>"It can be put in very few words. The deserved success
of your play and the poems, following a natural law
that one too helplessly wishes otherwise, has led to a crisis
in the gossip&mdash;malicious in origin, certainly&mdash;which has
fastened upon you and Hunt; and this gossip lately has
taken a more sinister turn. More and more openly it is
being said that the circumstances surrounding Mrs. Hunt's
death ought to be probed&mdash;'probed' is just now the popular
word in this connection. The feeling is widespread that
you were in some way responsible for it.</p>

<p>"I must use brutal phrases to lay the truth before you.
You are not, seemingly, suspected of murder. You are suspected
of having killed Mrs. Hunt during a sudden access
of mental irresponsibility. It is whispered that Hunt, improperly,
in some devious way, got the matter hushed up
and the affair reported as an accident. As a result of these
absurd and terrible rumors, Hunt finds himself a pariah&mdash;many
of his oldest acquaintances no longer recognize him
when they meet. It is a thoroughly distressing situation,
and it's difficult to see how the mad injustice of it can be
easily righted.</p>

<p>"The danger is, of course, that some misguided person
will get the whole matter into the newspapers; it is really
a miracle that it has not already been seized on by some
yellow sheet, the opportunity for a sensational story is so
obviously ripe. Happily"&mdash;oh, Phil! oh, philosopher!&mdash;"the
present curious tension in European politics is for
the moment turning journalistic eyes far from home. But
as all such diplomatic flurries do, this one will pass, leaving
the flatness of the silly season upon us. This is what
Hunt most fears; and when you next see him you will find
him grayer and older because of this anxiety.</p>

<p>"He dreads, for you, a sudden journalistic demand for
a public investigation, and feels&mdash;though in this I can
hardly agree with him&mdash;that such a demand could end only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
in a public trial, in view of the peculiar nature of all the
circumstances involved&mdash;a veritable <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>.</p>

<p>"How shocking all this must be to you. The sense of
the mental anguish I'm causing you is a horror to me.
Nothing could have induced me to write in this way but
the compulsion of my love for Hunt and you. It seems
to me imperative that your names should be publicly
cleared, in advance of any public outcry.</p>

<p>"So I urge you, Susan&mdash;fully conscious of my personal
responsibility in doing so&mdash;to return at once and to join
with Hunt and your true friends in quashing finally and
fully these damnable lies. It is my strong conviction that
this is your duty to yourself, to Hunt, and to us all.
If you and Hunt, together or separately, make a public
statement, in view of the rumors now current, and yourselves
demand the fullest public investigation of the facts,
there can be but one issue. Your good names will be
cleared; the truth will prevail. Dreadful as this prospect
must be for you both, it now seems to me&mdash;and let me
add, to Jimmy&mdash;the one wise course for you to take. But
only you, if you agree with me, can persuade Hunt to
such a course.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p></div>

<p>It is unnecessary to quote the remaining paragraphs of
Phil's so characteristic letter.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>No doubt Susan would have returned immediately if she
could, but, less than a week after the receipt of Phil's
letter, the diplomatic flurry in Europe had taken a German
army through Luxemburg and into Belgium, and within
less than two weeks Susan and Mona Leslie and the Comtesse
de Bligny were in uniform, working a little less than
twenty-four hours a day with the Belgian Red Cross.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>It is no purpose of mine to attempt any description of
Susan's war experience or service. Those first corroding
weeks and months of the war have left ineffaceable scars
on the consciousness of the present generation. I was not
a part of them, and can add nothing to them by talking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
about them at second hand. It might, however, repay you
to read&mdash;if you have not already done so&mdash;a small anonymous
volume which has passed through some twenty or
thirty editions, entitled <i>Stupidity Triumphant</i>, and containing
the brief, sharply etched personal impressions of a
Red Cross nurse in Flanders during the early days of
Belgium's long agony. It is now an open secret that this
little book was written by Susan; and among the countless
documents on frightfulness this one, surely, by reason of its
simplicity and restraint, its entire absence of merely hysterical
outcry, is not the least damning and not&mdash;I venture
to believe&mdash;the least permanent.</p>

<p>There is one short paragraph in this book of detached
pictures, marginal notes, and condensed reflections that
brought home to me, personally, <i>war</i>, the veritable thing
itself, as no other written lines were able to do&mdash;as nothing
was able to do until I had seen the beast with my own
eyes. It is not an especially striking paragraph, and just
why it should have done so I am unable to say. Certain
extracts from the book have been widely quoted&mdash;one even,
I am told, was read out in Parliament by Arthur Henderson&mdash;but
I have never seen this one quoted anywhere; so
I am rather at a loss to explain its peculiar influence on me.
Entirely individual reactions to the printed word are
always a little mysterious. I know, for example, one
usually enlightened and catholic critic who stubbornly
maintains that a very commonplace distich by Lord De
Tabley is the most magical moment in all English verse.
But here is my paragraph&mdash;or Susan's&mdash;for what it is
worth:</p>

<p>"This Pomeranian prisoner was a blond boy-giant; pitifully
shattered; it was necessary to remove his left leg to
the knee. The operation was rapidly but skillfully performed.
He was then placed on a pallet, close beside the
cot of a wounded German officer. After coming out of the
ether his fever mounted and he grew delirious. The German
officer commanded him to be silent. He might just as
well have commanded the sun to stand still, and he must,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
however muzzily, have known that. Yet he was outraged
by this unconscious act of insubordination. Thrice he repeated
his absurd command&mdash;then raised himself with a
groan, leaned across, and struck the delirious boy in the
face with a weakly clenched fist. It was not a heavy blow;
the officer's strength did not equal his intention. '<i>Idiot!</i>'
I cried out; and thrust him back on his cot, half-fainting
from the pain of his futile effort at discipline. 'Idiot' was,
after all, the one appropriate word. It was constantly, I
found, the one appropriate word. The beast was a stupid
beast."</p>

<h2>THE LAST CHAPTER</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<div class='cap'>PHIL FARMER and Jimmy Kane stayed on in New
Haven that summer of 1914; Phil to be near his precious
sources in the Yale library; Jimmy to be near his
new job. As soon as his examinations were over he had
gone to work in a factory in a very humble capacity; but
he was not destined to remain there long in any capacity,
nor was it written in the stars that he was to complete
his education at Yale.</div>

<p>My own reasons for clinging to New Haven were less
definite. Sheer physical inertia had something to do with
it, no doubt; but chiefly I stayed because New Haven in
midsummer is a social desert; and in those days my most
urgent desire was to be alone. Apart from all else, the
breaking out of almost world-wide war had drastically, as
if by an operation for spiritual cataract, opened my inner
eye, no longer a bliss in solitude, to much that was trivial
and self-satisfied and ridiculous in one Ambrose Hunt, Esq.
That Susan should be in the smoke of that spreading horror
brought it swiftly and vividly before me. I lived the
war from the first.</p>

<p>For years, with no felt discomfort to myself, I had been
a pacifist. I was a contributing member of several peace
societies, and in one of my slightly better-known essays I
had expounded with enthusiasm Tolstoy's doctrine&mdash;which,
in spite of much passionate argument to the contrary these
troublous times, was assuredly Christ's&mdash;of nonresistance
to evil. I was, in fact, though in a theoretical, parlor sense
a proclaimed Tolstoyan, a Christian anarchist&mdash;lacking,
however, the essential groundwork for Tolstoy's doctrine:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
faith. Faith in God as a person, as a father, I could not
confess to; but the higher anarchist vision of humanity
freed from all control save that of its own sweet reasonableness,
of men turned unfailingly gentle, mutually helpful,
content to live simply if need be, but never with unuplifted
hearts&mdash;well, I could and did confess publicly that
no other vision had so strong an attraction for me!</p>

<p>I liked to dwell in the idea of such a world, to think of
it as a possibility&mdash;less remote, perhaps, than mankind in
general supposed. Having lived through the Spanish War,
the Boer War, and Russia's war with Japan; and in a
world constantly strained to the breaking point by national
rivalries, commercial expansion, and competition for markets;
by class struggles everywhere apparent; by the harsh,
discordant energies of its predatory desires&mdash;I, nevertheless,
had been able to persuade myself that the darkest
days of our dust-speck planet were done with and recorded;
Earth and its graceless seed of Adam were at last, to quote
Jimmy, "on their way"&mdash;well on their way, I assured
myself, toward some inevitable region of abiding and
beneficent light!</p>

<p><i>Pouf!</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And then?</p>

<p>Stricken in solitude, I went down into dark places and
fumbled like a starved beggar amid the detritus of my
dreams. Dust and shadow.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Was there anything real
there, anything worth the pain of spiritual salvage? Had
I been, all my life, merely one more romanticist, one more
sentimental trifler in a universe whose ways were not those
of pleasantness, nor its paths those of peace? Surely, yes;
for my heart convicted me at once of having wasted all my
days hitherto in a fool's paradise. The rough fabric of
human life was not spun from moonshine. So much at
least was certain. And nothing else was left me. Hurled
from my private, make-believe Eden, I must somehow begin
anew.</p>

<div class='center'>
"<i>Brief beauty, and much weariness.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i>"<br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Susan's line haunted me throughout the first desperate
isolation of those hours. I saw no light. I was broken in
spirit. I was afraid.</p>

<p>Morbidity, you will say. Why, yes; why not? To be
brainsick and heartsick in a cruel and unfamiliar world
is to be morbid. I quite agree. Below the too-thin crust
of a <i>dilettante's</i> culture lies always that hungry morass. A
world had been shaken; the too-thin crust beneath my feet
had crumbled; I must slither now in slime, and either sink
there finally, be swallowed up in that sucking blackness,
or by some miracle of effort win beyond, set my feet on stiff
granite, and so survive.</p>

<p>It is most probable that I should never have reached solid
ground unaided. It was Jimmy, of all people, who
stretched forth a vigorous, impatient hand.</p>

<p>Shortly after the First Battle of the Marne had dammed&mdash;we
knew not how precariously, or how completely&mdash;the
deluge pouring through Belgium and Luxemburg and
Northern France, Jimmy burst in on me one evening. He
had just received a brief letter from Susan. She was
stationed then at Furnes; Mona Leslie was with her; but
their former hostess, the young pleasure-loving Comtesse
de Bligny, was dead. The cause of her death Susan did
not even stop to explain.</p>

<p>"Mona," she hurried on, "is magnificent. Only a few
months ago I pitied her, almost despised her; now I could
kiss her feet. How life had wasted her! She doesn't know
fear or fatigue, and she has just put her entire fortune unreservedly
at the service of the Belgian Government&mdash;to
found field hospitals, ambulances, and so on. The king
has decorated her. Not that she cares&mdash;has time to think
about it, I mean. In a sense it irritated her; she spoke
of it all to me as an unnecessary gesture. Oh, Jimmy, come
over&mdash;we need you here! Bring all America over with you&mdash;if
you can! <i>Setebos</i> invented neutrality; I recognize his
workmanship! Bring Ambo&mdash;bring Phil! Don't stop to
think about it&mdash;<i>come!</i>"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm going of course," said Jimmy. "So's Prof. Farmer.
How about you, sir?"</p>

<p>"Phil's going?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Just as soon as he can arrange it."</p>

<p>"His book's finished?"</p>

<p>"What the hell has that&mdash;&mdash;" began Jimmy; then
stopped dead, blushing. "Excuse me, Mr. Hunt; but books,
somehow&mdash;just now&mdash;they don't seem so important as&mdash;<i>see?</i>"</p>

<p>"Not quite, Jimmy. After all, the real struggle's always
between ideas, isn't it? We can't perfect the world with
guns and ambulances, Jimmy."</p>

<p>"Maybe not," said Jimmy dryly.</p>

<p>"It's quite possible," I insisted, "that Phil's book might
accomplish more for humanity, in the long run, than anything
he could do at his age in Flanders."</p>

<p>"Susan could come home and write plays," said Jimmy;
"good ones, too. But she won't. You can bet on that,
sir."</p>

<p>"I've never believed in war, Jimmy; never believed it
could possibly help us onward."</p>

<p>"Maybe it can't," interrupted Jimmy. "I've never believed
in cancer, either; it's very painful and kills a lot of
people. You'd better come with us, sir. You'll be sorry
you didn't&mdash;if you don't."</p>

<p>"Why? You know my ideas on nonresistance, Jimmy."</p>

<p>"Oh, ideas!" grunted Jimmy. "I know you're a white
man, Mr. Hunt. That's enough for me. I'm not worrying
much about your ideas."</p>

<p>"But whatever we do, Jimmy, there's an <i>idea</i> behind it;
there must be."</p>

<p>"Nachur'ly," said Jimmy. "Those are the only ones
that count! I can't see you letting Susan risk her life day
in an' out to help people who are being wronged, while
you sit over here and worry about what's going to happen
in a thousand years or so&mdash;after we're all good and dead!
Not much I can't! The point is, there's the rotten mess&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Susan's in it, trying to make it better&mdash;and we're not.
Prof. Farmer got it all in a flash! He'll be round presently
to make plans. Well&mdash;how about it, sir?"</p>

<p>Granite! Granite at last, unshakable, beneath my feet!</p>

<p>Then, too, Susan was over there, and Jimmy and Phil
were going, without a moment's hesitation, at her behest!
But I have always hoped, and I do honestly believe, that it
was not entirely that.</p>

<p>No; romanticist or not, I will not submit to the assumption
that of two possible motives for any decently human
action, it is always the lower motive that turns the trick.
La Rochefoucauld to the contrary, self-interest is not the
inevitable mainspring of man; though, sadly I admit, it
seems to be an indispensable cog-wheel in his complicated
works.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>And now, properly apprehensive reader&mdash;whom, in the
interests of objectivity, which has never interested me, I
should never openly address&mdash;are you not unhappy in the
prospect of another little tour through trench and hospital,
of one more harrowing account of how the Great War made
a Great Man of him at last?</p>

<p>Be comforted! One air raid I cannot spare you; but I
can spare you much. To begin with, I can spare you, or
all but spare you, a month or so over three whole years.</p>

<p>You may think it incredible, but it is merely true, that
I had been in Europe for more than three years&mdash;and I
had not as yet seen Susan. Phil had seen her, just once;
Jimmy had seen her many times; and I had run into them&mdash;singly,
never together&mdash;off and on, here and there, during
those slow-swift days of unremitting labor. If to labor
desperately in a heartfelt cause be really to pray, the ear
of Heaven has been besieged! But, in common humanity,
there was always more crying to be done than mortal brains
or hands or accumulated wealth could compass. Once
plunged into that glorious losing struggle against the appalling
hosts of Misery, one could only fight grimly on&mdash;on&mdash;on&mdash;to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the last hoarded ounce of strength and determination.</p>

<p>But the odds were hopeless, fantastic! Those Titan
forces of human suffering and degradation, so half-wittedly
let loose throughout Europe, grew ever vaster, more terrible
in maleficent power. They have ravaged the world;
they have ravaged the soul. An armistice has been signed,
a peace treaty is being drafted, a League of Nations is
being formed&mdash;or deformed&mdash;but those Titan forces still
mock our poor efforts with calamitous laughter. They are
still in fiercely, stubbornly disputed, but unquestionable
possession of the field&mdash;insolent conquerors to this hour.
The real war, the essential war, the war against the unconsciously
self-willed annihilation of earth's tragic egoist,
Man, has barely begun. Its issue is ever uncertain; and it
will not be ended in our days.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Phil and Jimmy had gone over on the same boat, <i>via</i>
England, about the middle of October, 1914. At that time
organized American relief-work in Europe was really nonexistent,
and in order to obtain some freedom of movement
on the other side, and a chance to study out possible opportunities
for effective service, Phil had persuaded Heywood
Sampson to appoint him continental correspondent
for the new review; and Jimmy went with him, ostensibly
as his private secretary.</p>

<p>It was all the merest excuse for obtaining passports and
permission to enter Belgium, if that should prove immediately
advisable after reaching London. It did not. Once
in London, Phil had very soon found himself up to the
eyes in work. Through Mr. Page, the American Ambassador&mdash;so
lately dead&mdash;he was introduced to Mr. Herbert C.
Hoover, and after a scant twenty minutes of conversation
was seized by Mr. Hoover and plunged, with barely a gasp
for breath, into that boiling sea of troubles&mdash;the organization
of the Commission for Relief in Belgium. It does not
take Mr. Hoover very long to size up the worth and stability
of any man; but in Phil he had found&mdash;and he knew
he had found&mdash;a peculiar treasure. Phil's unfailing patience,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
his thoroughness and courtesy, quickly endeared him
to all his colleagues and did much to make possible the
successful launching of the vastest and most difficult project
for relief ever undertaken by mortal men. Thus, almost
overnight, Jimmy's private secretaryship became anything
but a sinecure. For nearly three months their labors held
them in London; then they were sent&mdash;not unadventurously&mdash;to
Brussels; there to arrange certain details of distribution
with Mr. Whitlock, the American Minister, and
with the directors of the Belgian <i>Comit&eacute; National</i>.</p>

<p>But from Brussels their paths presently diverged.
Jimmy, craving activity, threw himself into the actual work
of food distribution in the stricken eastern districts; while
Phil passed gravely on to Herculean labors at the shipping
station of the "C. R. B." in Rotterdam. He remained in
Rotterdam for upward of a year. Susan, meanwhile, had
been driven with the Belgian Army from Furnes, and was
now attached to the operating-room of a small field or
receiving-hospital, which squatted amphibiously in a waterlogged
fragment of village not far from the Yser and the
flooded German lines. It was a post of danger, constantly
under fire; and she was the one woman who clung to it&mdash;who
insisted upon being permitted to cling to it, and carried
her point; and, under conditions fit neither for man
nor beast, unflinchingly carried on. Mona Leslie was no
longer beside her. She had retired to Dunkirk to aid in
the organization of relief for ever-increasing hordes of
civilian refugees.</p>

<p>And where, meanwhile, was one Ambrose Hunt, sometime
<i>dilettante</i> at large?</p>

<p>It had proved impossible for me to sail with Phil and
Jimmy. Just as the preliminary arrangements were being
made, Aunt Belle was stricken down by apoplexy, while
walking among the roses of her famous Spanish gardens in
Santa Barbara, and so died, characteristically intestate,
and, to my astonishment, I found that I had become the
sole inheritor of her estate; all of "Hyena Parker's"
tainted millions had suddenly poured their burdensome<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
tide of responsibilities&mdash;needlessly and unwelcomely&mdash;upon
me. There was nothing for it. Out to California, willy-nilly,
I must go, and waste precious weeks there with
lawyers and house agents and other tiresome human
necessities.</p>

<p>The one cheering thought in all this annoying pother
was&mdash;and it was a thought that grew rapidly in significance
to me as I journeyed westward&mdash;that fate had now made
it possible for me to purify Hyena Parker's millions by
putting them to work for mankind.&mdash;Well, they have since
done their part, to the last dollar; they have spent themselves
in the losing battle against Misery, and are no more.
Nothing became their lives like the ending of them. But
for all that, the world, you see, is as it is&mdash;and the battle
goes on.</p>

<p>Phil kept in touch with me from the other side, in spite
of his difficulties&mdash;as did Jimmy and Susan&mdash;and he had
prepared the way for me when at length I could free myself
and sail. I was instructed to go to Paris, direct, and
fulfill certain duties there in connection with the ever-increasing
burdens and exasperations of the "C. R. B."
I did so. Six months later my activities were transferred
to Berne; and&mdash;not to trace in detail the evolution of my
career, such as it was; for though useful, I hope, it was
never, like Phil's, exceptionally brilliant&mdash;I had become,
about the period of America's entry into the war, a modest
captain in the Red Cross, stationed at Evian, in connection
with the endless, heartbreaking task of repatriating
refugees from the invaded districts. And there my job
rooted me until January of that dark winter of our unspeakable
depression, 1918.</p>

<p>With the beginning of America's entry into the war Phil
had gone to Petrograd for the American Red Cross, his
commission being to save the lives of as many Russian
babies as possible by the distribution of canned milk. Then,
one evening&mdash;early in September, 1917, it must have been&mdash;he
started alone for Moscow, to lay certain wider plans
for disinterested relief-work before the sinister, the almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
mythical Lenine. That is the last that has ever been seen
of him, and no word has ever come forth directly from
him out of the chaos men still call Russia. The Red Cross
and the American and French Governments have done
their utmost to discover his whereabouts, without avail.
There are reasons for believing he is not dead, nor even
a prisoner. The dictators of the soviet autocracy have
been unable to find a trace of him, so they affirm; and there
are reasons also for believing that this is true.</p>

<p>As for Jimmy, you will not be surprised to learn that
Jimmy had not long been content with relief-work of any
kind. He was young; and he had <i>seen</i> things&mdash;there, in the
eastern districts. By midsummer of 1915 he had resigned
from the "C. R. B.," had made a difficult way to Paris,
via Holland and England, had enlisted in the Foreign
Legion, and had succeeded in getting himself transferred
to the French Flying Corps. Thus, months before we had
officially abandoned our absurd neutrality, he was flying
over the lines&mdash;bless him! If Jimmy never became a world-famous
ace, well&mdash;there was a reason for that, too; the best
of reasons. He was never assigned to a combat squadron,
for no one brought home such photographs as Jimmy; taken
tranquilly, methodically, at no great elevation, and often
far back of the German lines. His quiet daring was the
admiration of his comrades; anti-aircraft batteries had no
terrors for him; his luck was proverbial, and he grew to
trust it implicitly, seeming to bear a charmed life.</p>

<p>But Susan's luck had failed her, at last. On Thanksgiving
Day of 1917 she was wounded in the left thigh by
a fragment of shrapnel, a painful wound whose effects
were permanent. She will always walk slowly, with a slight
limp, hereafter. Mona Leslie got her down as far as Paris
by January 20, 1918, meaning to take her on to Mentone,
where she had rented a small villa for three months of long-overdue
rest and recuperation for them both. But on
reaching Paris, Susan collapsed; the accumulated strain of
the past years struck her down. She was taken to the
comfortable little Red Cross hospital for civilians at Neuilly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
and put to bed. A week of dangerous exhaustion and persistent
insomnia followed.</p>

<p>I knew nothing of it directly, at the moment. I knew
only that on a certain day Miss Leslie had planned to
start with Susan from Dunkirk for Mentone; I was waiting
eagerly for word of their safe arrival in that haven of rest
and beauty; and I was scheming like a junior clerk for my
first vacation, for two weeks off, perhaps even three, that
I might run down to them there. But no word came.
Throughout that first week in Paris, Miss Leslie in her
hourly anxiety neglected to drop me a line.</p>

<p>And then one night, as I sat vacantly on the edge of my
bed in my hotel room at Evian, almost too weary to begin
the tedious sequence of undressing and tumbling into it,
came the second of my psychic reels, my peculiar visions;
briefer, this one, than my first; but no less authentic in impression,
and no less clear.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>I saw, this time, the interior of a small white room,
almost bare of furniture, evidently a private room in some
thoroughly appointed modern hospital. The patient beneath
the white coverlet of the single white-enamelled iron
bed was Susan&mdash;or the wraith of Susan, so wasted was she,
so still. My breath stopped: I thought it had been given
me to see her at the moment of death; or already dead.
Then the door of the small white room opened, and Jimmy&mdash;in
his smart horizon-blue uniform with its coveted
shoulder loop, the green-and-red <i>fourag&egrave;re</i> that bespoke
the bravery of his entire <i>esquadrille</i>&mdash;came in, treading
carefully on the balls of his feet. As he approached the
bedside Susan opened her eyes&mdash;great shadows, gleamless
soot-smudges in her pitifully haggard face. It seemed that
she was too weak even to greet him or smile; her eyes closed
again, and Jimmy bent down to her slowly and kissed her.
Then Susan lifted her right hand from the coverlet&mdash;I
could feel the effort it cost her&mdash;and touched Jimmy's hair.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
There was no strength in her to prolong the caress. The
hand slipped from him to her breast.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And my vision
ended.</p>

<p>Its close found me on my knees on the tiled floor of my
bedroom, as if I too had tried to go nearer, to bring myself
close to her bedside, perhaps to bury my face in my hands
against the white coverlet, her shroud; to weep there.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I sprang up, wildly enough now, with a harsh shudder,
the terrified gasp of a brute suddenly stricken from
ambush, aware only of rooted claws and a last crushing
fury of deep-set fangs.</p>

<p>Susan was dying. I knew not where. I could not reach
her. But Jimmy had reached her. He had been summoned.
He had not been too late.</p>

<p>There are moments of blind anguish not to be reproduced
for others. Chaos is everything&mdash;and nothing. It cannot
be described.</p>

<p>There was nothing really useful I could do that night,
not even sleep. In those days, it was impossible to move
anywhere on the railroads of France without the proper
passes and registrations of intention with the military
authorities and the local police. I could, of course, suffer&mdash;that
is always a human possibility&mdash;and I could attempt,
muzzily enough, to think, to make plans. Where was it
most likely that Susan would be? Was the hospital room
that I had seen in Dunkirk, or in Nice, or at some point
between&mdash;perhaps at Paris? It could hardly, I decided,
be at Dunkirk; that stricken city, whose inhabitants were
forced to dive like rats into burrows at any hour of the day
or night. There was nothing to suggest the atmosphere of
Dunkirk in that quiet, white-enamelled room. Nice, then&mdash;or
Mentone? Hardly, I again reasoned; for Jimmy could
not easily have reached them there. A day's leave; a flight
from the lines, so comfortlessly close to Paris&mdash;that was
always possible to the air-men, who were in a sense privileged
characters, being for the most part strung with taut
nerves that chafed and snapped under too strict a discipline.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
And in Paris there must be many such quiet,
white-enamelled rooms. I decided for Paris.</p>

<p>Then I threw five or six articles and a bar of chocolate
into my <i>musette</i>, a small water-proof pouch to sling over
the shoulder&mdash;three years had taught me at least the needlessness
of almost all Hillhouse necessities&mdash;and waited for
dawn. It came, as all dawns come at last&mdash;even in January,
even in France. And with it came a gulp of black
coffee in the little deserted caf&eacute; down-stairs&mdash;and a telegram.
I dared not open the telegram. It lay beside my
plate while I stained the cloth before me and scalded my
throat and furred my tongue. It was from Paris. So my
decision was justified, and now quite worthless.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
have no memory of the interval; but I had got with it somehow
back to my room&mdash;that accursed blue envelope!
Well&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Susan at Red Cross hospital for civilians, Neuilly. All
in, but no cause for real worry. Is sleeping now for first
time in nearly a week. I must leave by afternoon. Come
up to her if you possibly can. She needs you.</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>."<br />
</div></div>

<p>Four hours later all my exasperatingly complicated
arrangements for a two-weeks' absence were made&mdash;the
requisite motions had been the purest somnambulism&mdash;and
by the ample margin of fifty seconds I had caught an
express&mdash;to do it that courtesy&mdash;moving with dignity, at
decent intervals, toward all that I lived by and despaired
of and held inviolably dear. But the irony of Jimmy's
last three words went always with me, a monotonous ache
blurring every impulse toward hope and joy. Susan was
not dead, was not dying! "No cause for real worry."
Jimmy would not have said that if he had feared the worst.
It was not his way to shuffle with facts; he was by nature
direct and sincere. No; Susan would recover&mdash;thank God
for it! Thank&mdash;and then, under all, through all, over and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
over, that aching monotony: "She needs you. Jimmy.
She needs you. Jimmy."</p>

<p>"Needs me!" I groaned aloud.</p>

<p>"<i>Pla&icirc;t-il?</i>" politely murmured the harassed-looking little
French captain, my vis-&agrave;-vis.</p>

<p>"<i>Mille pardons, monsieur</i>," I murmured back. "<i>On a
quelquefois des griefs particuliers, vous savez.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Ah dame, oui!</i>" he sighed. "<i>Par le temps qui court!</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Et ce pachyderme de train qui ne court jamais!</i>" I
smiled.</p>

<p>"<i>Ah, pour &ccedil;a&mdash;&ccedil;a repose!</i>" murmured the little French
captain, and shut his eyes.</p>

<p>"She needs you. Jimmy. She needs you. Jimmy. She
needs&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then, miraculously, for two blotted hours I slept. But I
woke again, utterly unrefreshed, to the old refrain: <i>She
needs you&mdash;needs you&mdash;needs you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p>

<p>The little French captain was still asleep, snoring now&mdash;but
softly&mdash;in his corner. Ah, lucky little French captain!
<i>&Ccedil;a repose!</i></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>One afternoon, five or six days later, I was seated by the
white-enamelled iron bed in the small white room. Susan
had had a long, quiet, normal nap, and her brisk sparrow-eyed
Norman nurse, in her pretty costume of the French
Red Cross, had come to me in the little reception-room of
the hospital, where I had been sitting for an hour stupidly
thumbing over tattered copies of ancient American magazines,
and had informed me&mdash;with rather an ambiguous
twinkle of those sparrow eyes&mdash;that her patient had asked
to see me as soon as she had waked, was evidently feeling
stronger, and that it was to be hoped <i>M. le Capitaine</i> would
be discreet and say nothing to excite or fatigue the poor
little one. "<i>Je me sauve, m'sieu</i>," she had added, mischievously
grave; "<i>on ne peut avoir l'&oelig;il &agrave; tout, mais&mdash;je
compte sur vous.</i>"</p>

<p>So innocently delighted had she been by her pleasant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
suspicions, it was impossible to let her feel how sharply
her raillery had pained me. But I could not reply in kind.
I had merely bowed, put down the magazine in my hand,
and so left her&mdash;to inevitable reflections, I presume, upon
the afflicting reticence of these otherwise so agreeable allies
<i>d'outre mer</i>. Their education was evidently deplorable.
One never knew when they would miss step, inconveniently,
and so disarrange the entire social rhythm of a conversation.</p>

<p>"Ambo," said Susan, putting her hand in mine, "do
you know at all how terribly I've missed you?" She turned
her head weakly on her pillow and looked at me. "You're
older, dear. You've changed. I like your face better now
than I ever did."</p>

<p>I wrinkled my nose at her. "Is that saying much?" I
grimaced.</p>

<p>"Heaps!" She attempted to smile back at me, but her
lower lip quivered. "Yours has always been my favorite
face, you know, Ambo. Phil's is wiser&mdash;somehow, and
stronger, too; and Jimmy's is sunnier, healthier, and&mdash;yes,
handsomer, dear! Nobody could call you handsome, could
they? But you're not ugly, either. Sister was adorably
ugly. It was a daily miracle to see the lamp in her suddenly
glow through and glorify everything. I used to
wait for it. It's the only thing that has ever made me
feel&mdash;humble; I never feel that way with you. I just feel
satisfied, content."</p>

<p>"Like putting on an old pair of slippers," I ventured.</p>

<p>"That's it," sighed Susan happily, and closed her eyes.</p>

<p>"That's it!" echoed my familiar demon, "but no one but
Susan would have admitted it."</p>

<p>As usual, I found it wiser to cut him dead.</p>

<p>"Well, dear," I said to Susan, "there's one good thing:
you'll be able to use the old pair of slippers any time you
need them now. I'm to be held in Paris, I find, for a three-months'
job."</p>

<p>She opened her eyes again; disapprovingly, I felt.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't have done that, Ambo! You're needed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
at Evian; I know you are. It's bad enough to be out of
things myself, but I won't drag you out of them! How
could you imagine that would please me?"</p>

<p>"I hoped it would, a little," I replied, "but it hasn't
any of it been my doing&mdash;Chatworth's wife's expecting a
baby in a few weeks, and he wants to run home to welcome
it; I'm to take on his executive work till he gets back. God
knows he needs a rest!"</p>

<p>"As if you didn't, too!" protested Susan, inconsistently
enough. Her eyes fell shut again; her hands slipped from
mine. "Ambo," she asked presently, in a thread of voice
that I had to lean down to her to hear, "have they told you
I can never have a baby now?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Wasn't it lucky if that
had to happen to some woman&mdash;it happened to me?"</p>

<p>No, they had not told me; and for the moment I could
not answer her.</p>

<p>"Jimmy's wife is going to have a baby soon," added
Susan.</p>

<p>"Jimmy's&mdash;<i>what!</i>" I shrieked. Yes, shrieked&mdash;for, to
my horror, I heard my voice crack and soar, strident, incredulous.</p>

<p>Susan was staring at me, wide-eyed, her face aquiver
with excitement; two deep spots of color flaming on her
thin cheeks.</p>

<p>"Didn't you <i>know?</i>"</p>

<p>The white door opened as she spoke, and Susan's Norman
nurse hurried in, her sparrow eyes transformed to stiletto
points of indignation. "<i>Ah, m'sieu&mdash;c'est trop fort!</i> When
I told you expressly to do nothing to excite the poor little
one!" I rose, self-convicted, before her.</p>

<p>"<i>Tais-toi, Annette!</i>" exclaimed Susan sharply, her eyes
too gleaming with indignation. "It is not your place to
speak so to m'sieu, a man old enough to be your father&mdash;and
more than a father to me! For shame! His surprise
was unavoidable! I have just given him a shock&mdash;unexpected
news! Good news, however, I am glad to say. Now
leave us!"</p>

<p>"On the contrary," replied Nurse Annette, four feet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
eleven of uncompromising and awful dignity, "I am in
charge here, and it is m'sieu who will leave&mdash;<i>tout court!</i>
But I regret my <i>vivacit&eacute;</i>, <i>m'sieu!</i>"</p>

<p>"It is nothing, mademoiselle. You have acted as you
should. It is for me to offer my regrets. But&mdash;when may
I return?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, m'sieu," said Nurse Annette.</p>

<p>"Naturally," said Susan. "Now sit down, please, Ambo,
and listen to me."</p>

<p>For an instant the stiletto points glinted dangerously;
then Nurse Annette giggled. That is precisely what Nurse
Annette did; she giggled. Then she twirled about on her
toes and left us&mdash;very quietly, yet not without a certain
malicious ostentation, closing the door.</p>

<p>The French are a brave people, an intelligent and industrious
people; but they exhibit at times a levity almost
childlike in the descendants of so ancient and so deeply
civilized a race.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"I knew nothing about it myself, Ambo," Susan was
saying, "until I was beginning to feel a little stronger,
after my operations at Dunkirk. Then Mona brought me
letters&mdash;three from you, dear, and one long one from
Jimmy. But no letter from Phil. I'd hoped, foolishly I
suppose, for that. Jimmy's was the dearest, funniest letter
I've ever read; it made me laugh and cry all at once. It
wasn't a bit good for me, Ambo. It used me all up! And
I kept wondering what you must be thinking. You see,
he said in it he had written you."</p>

<p>"I've had no letter from Jimmy for at least five or six
months," I replied.</p>

<p>"So many letters start bravely off over here," sighed
Susan, "and then just vanish&mdash;like Phil. How many heartbreaks
they must have caused, all those vanished letters&mdash;and
men. And how silly of me to think about it! There
must be some fatal connection, Ambo, between being sick
and being sentimental. I suppose sentimentality's always
one symptom of weakness. I've never been so disgustingly
maudlin as these past weeks&mdash;never!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"So Jimmy's married," I repeated stupidly, for at least
the third time.</p>

<p>"Yes," smiled Susan, "to little Jeanne-Marie Val&eacute;rie
Josephine Aulard. I haven't seen her, of course, but I feel
as if I knew her well. They've been married now almost
a year." She paused again. "Why don't you look gladder,
Ambo? Why don't you ask questions? You must be dying
to know why Jimmy kept it a secret from us so long."</p>

<p>I had not dared to ask questions, for I believed I could
guess why Jimmy had kept it a secret from us so long. For
the first time in his life, I thought, Jimmy had been a
craven. He had been afraid to tell Susan of an event
which he must know would be like a knife in her heart.</p>

<p>"I suppose I'm foolishly hurt about it," I mumbled.</p>

<p>How bravely she was taking it all, in spite of her physical
exhaustion! Poor child, poor child! But in God's name
what then was the meaning of my vision back there in the
hotel room at Evian? Jimmy entering this room where I
now sat, tiptoeing to this very bedside, stooping down and
kissing Susan&mdash;and her hand lifted, overcoming an almost
mortal weakness, to touch his hair.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"You mustn't be hurt at all," Susan gently rebuked me.
"Jimmy kept his marriage a secret from us for a very
Jimmyesque reason. There was nothing specially exciting
or romantic about the courtship itself, though. Little
Jeanne-Marie's father&mdash;he was a notary of Soissons who
had made a nice, comfy little fortune for those parts&mdash;died
just before the war. So the Widow Aulard retired with
Jeanne-Marie to a brand-spandy-new, very ugly little country
house&mdash;south of the Aisne, Ambo, not far from Soissons;
the canny old notary had just completed it as a haven
for his declining years when he up and died. Well then,
during the first German rush, Widow Aulard&mdash;being a good
extra-stubborn <i>bourgeoise</i>&mdash;refused to leave her home&mdash;refused,
Jeanne-Marie told Jimmy, even to believe the Boches
would ever really be permitted to come so far. That was
foolish, of course&mdash;but doesn't it make you like her, and
<i>see</i> her&mdash;mustache and all?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>"But the deluge was too much, even for her. One morning,
after a night of terror, she found herself compulsory
housekeeper, and little Jeanne-Marie compulsory servant,
to a kennel of Bavarian officers. Then, three weeks or so
later, the orderly of one of these officers, an Alsatian, was
discovered to be a spy and was shot&mdash;and the Widow
Aulard was shot, too, for having unwittingly harbored him.
Jeanne-Marie wasn't shot, though; the kennel liked her
cooking. So, like the true daughter of a French notary,
she used her wits, made herself indispensable to the comfort
of the officers, preserved her dignity under incredible
insults, and her virtue under conditions I needn't tell you
about, Ambo&mdash;and bided her time.</p>

<p>"It nearly killed her; but she lived through it, and
finally the French returned and helped her patch up and
clean up what was left of the kennel. And a month or so
later Jimmy's <i>esquadrille</i> made Jeanne-Marie's battered
little house their headquarters and treated its mistress like
the staunch little heroine she is. Of course, Jimmy wasn't
attached to the <i>esquadrille</i> then; it was more than a year
later that he arrived on the scene; but it didn't take him
long after getting there to decide on an international
alliance. Bless him! he says Jeanne-Marie isn't very pretty,
he guesses; she's just&mdash;wonderful! She couldn't make up
her mind to the international alliance, though. She loved
Jimmy, but the match didn't strike her as prudent. An
orphan must consider these things. Her property had been
swept away, and Jimmy admitted he had nothing. And
being her father's daughter, Jeanne-Marie very wisely
pointed out that he was in hourly peril of being killed or
crippled for life. To marry under such circumstances
would be to make her father turn in his grave. How can
anything so sad be so funny, Ambo? Well, anyway, Jimmy,
being Jimmy, saw the point, agreed with her completely,
and seems to have felt thoroughly ashamed of himself for
trying to persuade her into so crazy a match!</p>

<p>"Then little Jeanne-Marie came down with typhoid; her
life was despaired of, a priest was summoned. In the presence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of death, she managed to tell the priest that it would
seem less lonely and terrible to her if she could meet it as
the wife 'M'sieu Jee-mee.' So the good priest managed
somehow to slash through yards of official red tape in no
time&mdash;you know how hard it is to get married in France,
Ambo!&mdash;and the sacrament of marriage preceded the last
rites; and then, dear, Jeanne-Marie faced the Valley of
Shadow clinging to M'sieu Jee-mee's hand. The whole
<i>esquadrille</i> was unstrung&mdash;naturally; even their famous
ace, Boisrobert. Jimmy says he absolutely refused to fly
for three days." Tears were pouring from Susan's eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a fool I am!" she protested, mopping at them
with a corner of the top sheet. "She didn't die, of course.
She rallied at the last moment and got well&mdash;and found
herself safely married after all, and quite ready to take
her chances of living happily with M'sieu Jee-mee ever
afterward! There&mdash;isn't that a nice story, Ambo? Don't
you like pretty-pie fairy tales when they happen to be
true?"</p>

<p>That she could ask me this with her heart breaking!
Again I could not trust myself to speak calmly, and I saw
that she was worn out with the effort she had made to overcome
her weakness, and what I believed to be a living pain
in her breast. I rose.</p>

<p>"Ambo!" she exclaimed, wide-eyed, "still you don't ask
me why Jimmy didn't tell us! How stupid of you to take
it all like this!"</p>

<p>"I've stayed too long, dear," I mumbled; "far too long.
I've let you talk too much. Why, it's almost dark! To-morrow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, <i>now</i>," she insisted, with a little frown of displeasure.
"I won't have you thinking meanly of Jimmy! It's
too absurdly unfair! I'm ashamed of you, Ambo."</p>

<p>How she idealized him! How she had always idealized
that normal, likable, essentially commonplace Irish boy&mdash;pouring
out, wasting for him treasures of unswerving
loyalty! It was damnable. But these things were the final
mysteries of life, these instinctive bonds, yielding no clue to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
reason. One could only accept them, bitterly, with a curse
or a groan withheld. Accept them&mdash;since one must.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"Well, dear," broke from me with a touch, almost, of
impatience, "I confess I'm more interested in your health
than in Jimmy's psychology! But I see you won't sleep
a wink if you don't tell me!"</p>

<p>"I've never known you to be so horrid," she said faintly,
all the weariness of body and soul returning upon her for a
moment, till she fought it back. She did so, to my amazement,
with an entirely unexpected chuckle, a true sharp,
clear Birch Street gleam. "You don't deserve it, Ambo,
but I'm going to make you smile a little, whether you feel
like it or not! The reason Jimmy didn't tell us was because&mdash;after
Jeanne-Marie got well&mdash;he spent weeks trying
to persuade her that a marriage made exclusively for
eternity oughtn't to be considered binding on this side!
She had been entirely certain, he kept pointing out to her,
that she ought not to marry him in this world, and she
had only done so when she thought she was being taken
from it." Susan chuckled again. "Can't you hear him,
Ambo&mdash;and her? Jimmy, feeling he had won something
precious through an unfair advantage and so refusing his
good fortune&mdash;or trying to; and practical Jeanne-Marie
simply nonplussed by his sudden lack of all common sense!
Besides which, wasn't marriage a sacrament, and wasn't
M'sieu Jee-mee a good Catholic? Was he going back on his
faith&mdash;or asking her to trifle with hers? And, anyway,
they were married&mdash;that was the end of it! And of course,
Ambo, it was&mdash;really. There! I knew sooner or later
you'd have to smile!"</p>

<p>"Did he give in gracefully?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, things soon settled themselves, I imagine, when
Jeanne-Marie was well enough to leave. Naturally, she
had to as soon as she could. A soldier's wife can't live with
him at the Front, you know&mdash;even to keep house for his
<i>esquadrille</i>. She's living here now, in Paris, with a distant
cousin, an old lady who runs a tiny shop near St.-Sulpice&mdash;sells
pious pamphlets and pink-and-blue plaster Virgins&mdash;you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
know the sort of thing, Ambo. You must call on her
at once in due form, dear. You must. I'm so eager to&mdash;when
I can." She paused on a breath, then added slowly,
her eyes closing, "The baby's expected in February&mdash;Jimmy's
baby."</p>

<p>The look on her face had puzzled me as I left her; a
look of quiet happiness, I must have said&mdash;if I had not
known.</p>

<p>And my vision at Evian&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>I walked back toward the barrier down endless darkening
avenues of suburban Neuilly; walked by instinct,
though quite unconscious of direction, straight to the Porte
Maillot, through the emotional nightmare of what my old
childhood nurse, Maggie, used always to call "a great state
of mind."</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>And that night&mdash;it was, I think, the thirtieth of January,
or was it the thirty-first?&mdash;fifty or sixty Boche
a&euml;roplanes came by detached squadrons over Paris
and, for the first time since the Zeppelins of 1916,
dropped a shower of bombs on the <i>agglom&eacute;ration Parisienne</i>.
It was an entirely successful raid, destructive of
property and life; for the German flyers in their powerful
Gothas had caught Paris napping, impotently unprepared.</p>

<p>I had dined that evening with an old acquaintance, doing
six-months' time, as it amused him to put it, with the purchasing
department of the Red Cross; a man who had long
since turned the silver spoon he was born with to solid
gold, and who could see no reason why, just because for
the first time in his life he was giving something for nothing,
he should deprive himself while doing so of the very
high degree of creature comfort he had always enjoyed. He
was stationed in Paris, and it was his invariable custom
to dine sumptuously at one of the more expensive restaurants.</p>

<p>This odd combination of service and sybaritism was not
much to my liking, seeming to indicate a curious lack of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
imaginative sympathy with the victims of that triumphing
Misery he was enlisted to combat; nevertheless, I had properly
appreciated my dinner. It is impossible not to appreciate
a well-ordered dinner, <i>chez</i> Durant, where wartime
limitations seemed never to weigh very heavily upon
the delicately imagined good cheer. True, the cost of
this good cheer was fantastic, and I shuddered a little
as certain memories of refugee hordes at Evian intruded
themselves between our golden mouthfuls; but the
bouquet of a fine mellowed Burgundy was in my nostrils
and soon proved an&aelig;sthetic to conscience. And
Arthur Dalton is a good table companion; his easy flow
of conversation quite as mellow often as the wine he knows
so well how to select. But that night, though I did my
poor best to emulate him, I fear he did not find an equal
combination of the soothing and the stimulating in me.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because I had bored him that I was
destined before we parted to catch a rather startling
glimpse of a new Arthur Dalton, new at least to me; a person
wholly different from the amusing man of the world I
had long, but so casually, known.</p>

<p>"Hunt," he said unexpectedly, over a final glass of old
yellow Chartreuse, a liquor almost unobtainable at any
price, "you've changed a lot since our days here together."
We had seen something of each other once in Paris, years
before, during a fine month of spring weather; it was the
year after my wife had left me. "A lot," he repeated;
"and I wish I could say for the better. You've aged, man,
before you're old. You've let life, somehow, get on your
nerves, depress you. Suffered your genial spirits to rot,
as the poet says. That's foolish. It's a kind of defeat&mdash;acceptance
of defeat. Now my philosophy is always to stay
on top&mdash;where the cream lies. Somebody's going to get it
if you and I don't, eh? Well, I'm having my share. I
don't want more and I'm damned if I'll take less. Anything
wrong with that point of view, old man? I'd be
willing to swear it used to be yours!"</p>

<p>"Never quite, I think," was my answer; "at least I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
never formulated it that way. I took things pretty easily
as they came, Dalt, and didn't worry about reasons. I've
never been a philosophical person, never lived up to any
consciously organized plan. If I had any God in those
days I suppose I named him 'Culture'; or worse still 'Good
Taste.' Not much of a god for these times," I added.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," Dalton struck in; "I'm not so sure
of that! I can't see that these times differ much from any
others. There's a big war on, yes; but that's nothing
new, is it? Looks to me pretty much like the same old
planet, right now. Never was much of a planet for the
great majority; never will be. A few of us get all the
prizes&mdash;always have. Some of us partly deserve 'em, but
most of us just happen to be lucky. I don't see anything
that's likely to change that arrangement. Do you?"</p>

<p>"They've changed it in Russia," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Not a bit!" exclaimed Dalton. "Some different people
have taken their big chance and climbed on top, that's all!
I doubt if they stay there long; still, they may. That fellow
Lenine, now; he has a kind of well-up-in-the-saddle
feel to him. Quite a boy, I've no doubt; and if he sticks,
I congratulate him! It's the one really amusing place to
be."</p>

<p>"You sound like a Junker war-lord," I smiled. "Fortunately,
I know your bark, and I've never seen you bite."</p>

<p>"My dear Hunt," said Dalton, lowering his voice, "my
teeth are perfectly sound, I assure you; and I've always
used 'em when I had to, believe <i>me</i>. It's the law of life, as
I read it. And just here between ourselves, eh&mdash;cutting out
all the nonsense we've learned to babble&mdash;do you see any
difference between a Junker war-lord and a British Tory
peer&mdash;or an American capitalist? Any real difference, I
mean? I'm all for licking Germany if we can, because if
we don't she'll control the cream supply of the world. But
I can't blame her for wanting to, and if she gets away with
it&mdash;which the devil forbid!&mdash;we'll all mighty soon forget
all the nasty things we've been saying about her and begin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
trying to lick her Prussian boots instead of her armies!
That's so, and you know it! Why, the most sickening
thing about this war, Hunt, isn't the loss of life&mdash;that may
be a benefit to us all in the end; no sir, it's the moral buncombe
it's let loose! That man Wilson simply sweats the
stuff day and night, drenches us with it&mdash;till we stink like
a church of Easter lilies. Come now! Doesn't it all, way
down in your tummy somewhere, give you a good honest
griping pain?"</p>

<p>I stared at him. Yes; the man was evidently in earnest;
was even, I could see, expecting me to smile&mdash;however
deprecatingly, for form's sake&mdash;and in the main agree with
him, as became my situation in life; my class. I had supposed
myself incapable of moral shock, but found now that
the sincerity of his cynicism had unquestionably shocked
me; I felt suddenly embarrassed, awkward, ashamed.</p>

<p>"Dalt," I finally managed, pretty lamely, "it's absurd,
I admit; but if I try to answer you, I shall lose my temper.
I mean it. And as I've dined wonderfully at your expense,
that's something I don't care to do."</p>

<p>It was his turn to stare at me.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say, Hunt, you've been caught by all
this sentimental parson's palaver? Brotherhood, peace on
earth, all the rest of it?"</p>

<p>My nerves snapped. "If you insist on a straight answer,"
I said, "you can have it: I've no use for a world
that spiritually starves its poets and saints, and physically
fattens its hyenas and hogs! And if that isn't sentimental
enough for you, I can go farther!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that'll do," he laughed, uncomfortably however.
"I'm always forgetting you're a scribbler, of sorts. You
scribblers are all alike&mdash;emotionally diseased. If you'd
only stick to your real job of amusing the rest of us, it
wouldn't matter. It's when you try to reform us that I
draw the line; have to. I can't afford to grow brainsick&mdash;abnormal.
Well," he added, pushing back his chair, "come
along anyway! We've just time to get over to the Casino<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and have a look at the only Gaby. Been there? It's a
cheap show, after Broadway, but it does well enough to
pass the time."</p>

<p>From this unalluring suggestion I begged off, justly
pleading a hard day of work ahead. "And if you don't
mind, Dalt, I'll walk home."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," he agreed; "I'll walk along with you,
if you'll take it easy. I'm not much for exercise, you
know. But it's a perfect night."</p>

<p>I had hoped ardently to be rid of him, but I managed to
accept his company with apparent good grace, and we
strolled down the Avenue Victor Hugo toward the Triumphal
Arch, bathed now in clearest moonlight, standing
forth to all Paris as a cruelly ironic symbol of Hope, never
relinquished, but endlessly deferred. Turning there, the
Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es, all but deserted at that hour in wartime
Paris, stretched on before us down a gentle slope, half
dusky, half glimmering, and wholly silent except for our
lonesome-sounding footfalls and the distant faint plopping
of a lame cab-horse's stumbling heels.</p>

<p>"Not much like the old town we knew once, eh, Hunt?"
asked Dalton.</p>

<p>But conversation soon faded out between us, as we made
our way through etched mysteries of black and silver under
thickset leafless branches. An occasional light beckoned us
from far ahead down our pavement vista; for Paris had
not yet fully become that city&mdash;not of dreadful&mdash;but of
majestic and beautiful night we were later to know, and
to love with so changed and grave a passion.</p>

<p>It was just after we had crossed the Rond-Point that the
first seven or eight bombs in swift even succession shatteringly
fell. They were not near enough to us to do more
than root us to the spot with amazement.</p>

<p>"What the <i>hell?</i>" muttered Dalton, holding my
eyes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Then, very far off, a curious thin wailing noise began,
increasing rapidly, rising to an eerie scream which doubled
and redoubled in volume as it was taken up in other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
quarters and came to us in intricately rhythmic waves.</p>

<p>"Sirens," said Dalton. "The <i>pompiers</i> are out. I guess
they've come, damn them, eh?"</p>

<p>"Seems so," I answered. "Yes; there go the lights.
I must get to Neuilly at once&mdash;a sick friend. So long, old
man."</p>

<p>"Hold on!" he called after me. "Don't be an ass!"</p>

<p>To my impatient annoyance, for they impeded my progress,
knots of people had sprung everywhere from the darkness
and were standing now in open spots, in the full
moonlight, murmuring together, as they stared with backward-craned
necks up into the spotless sky.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>So, with crashing, sinister, unresolved chords, began the
Straussian overture to the great Boche symphony, <i>Gott
Strafe Paris</i>, played to its impotent conclusion throughout
those bitter spring months of the year of our wonderment,
1918! Ninety-one bombs were dropped that night within
the old fortifications; more than two hundred were
showered on the <i>banlieue</i>. No subsequent raid was to prove
equally destructive of property or life, and it was disturbingly
evident that, for the time being at least, the shadowy
air lanes to Paris lay broadly open to the foe.</p>

<p>Yet, for some reason unexplained, the Gothas did not
immediately or soon return. Followed a hush of rather
more than a month, during which Paris worked breathlessly
to improve its air defenses and protect its more precious
monuments. Comically ugly little sausage-balloons&mdash;gorged
caterpillars, they seemed, raw yellow with pale green
articulations and loathsome, floppy appendages&mdash;were
moored in the squares and public gardens; mountains of
sand bags were heaped about the Triumphal Arch and
before the portals of Notre Dame; spies were hunted out,
proclamations issued, the entrance ways to deep cellars
were placarded; and Night, that long-exiled princess, came
back to us, royally, in full mourning robes. In her honor
all windows were doubly curtained, all street lamps extinguished,
or dimmed with paint to a heavy blue. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
invoked the august amplitude of darkness and would gladly
have banished the trivial prying moon, seeing her at last in
true colors for the sinister corpse light of heaven which she
is. No one, I think, was deceived by this lengthening
interval of calm. Why the Gothas did not at once return,
what restrained them from following up their easy
triumph, we could not guess; but we knew they would
come again, would come many times.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, for most of us who dwelt there, life went
on as before, busily enough; but for one of us&mdash;as for how
many another&mdash;this no longer mattered.</p>

<p>Brave little Jeanne-Marie Val&eacute;rie Josephine Aulard, on
that night of anguish, died in giving premature birth to
Jimmy's son, James Aulard Kane&mdash;as Susan later named
him: for this wizened, unready morsel of man's flesh, in
spite of every disadvantage attending his d&eacute;but and first
motherless weeks on earth, clung with the characteristic
tenacity of his parents to his one obvious line of duty,
which was merely to keep alive in despite of fortune: a
duty he somehow finally accomplished to his own entire
satisfaction and to the blessed relief of Susan and of me.
But I shall never forget my first pitiful introduction to
James Aulard Kane.</p>

<p>After leaving Dalton, that night, I had finally made my
way to Susan's hospital on foot, which I had soon found
to be the one practicable means of locomotion. It was a
long walk, and it brought me in due course into the Avenue
de la Grande Arm&eacute;e, just in time to receive the full stampeding
effect of the three bombs which fell there, the nearest
of them not four hundred yards distant from me. I am
by no means instinctively intrepid; quite the contrary; I
shy like a skittish horse in the presence of danger, and my
first authentic impulse is always to cut and run. On this
occasion, by the time I had mastered this impulse, I had
placed a good six hundred yards between me and that ill-fated
building, whose stone-faced upper floors had been
riven and hurled down to the broad avenue below. Then,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
shamefacedly enough, I turned and forced myself back
toward that smoking ruin.</p>

<p>Our American ambulances from Neuilly were already
arriving&mdash;the <i>pompiers</i> came later&mdash;and the police lines
were being drawn. A civilian spectator, even though a
captain of the Red Cross, could render no real assistance;
so much, after certain futile efforts on my part, was made
clear to me, profanely, in a Middle Western accent, by a
young stretcher-bearer whose course I had clumsily impeded.
Clouds of lung-choking dust, milk-white as the
moon's full rays played upon them, rolled over us&mdash;the
subdued crowd that gathered slowly, oblivious of further
danger. The air was full of whispered rumor&mdash;throughout
Paris hundreds&mdash;thousands, said some&mdash;had already died.
We were keyed to believe the wildest exaggerations, to
accept the worst that excited imaginations could invent for
us. Yet there was no panic; no one gave way to hysterical
outcry; and the fall of more distant bombs brought only a
deep common groan, compounded of growling imprecations&mdash;a
groan truly of defiance and loathing, into which neither
fear nor pity for the victims of this frightfulness could
find room to enter. I cursed with the rest, instinctively,
from the pit of my stomach, and turned raging away; my
whole being ached, was congested with rage. For the first
time in my life I then felt in its full hell-born fury that
passion so often named, but so seldom experienced by
civilized&mdash;or what we call civilized&mdash;man: the passion of
<i>hate</i>.</p>

<p>By the time I had reached the hospital the raid was over;
the air was droning from the bronze vibrations of hundreds
of bells, all the church-bells of Paris, full-throated, calling
forth their immediate surface messages of cheer, their
deeper message of courage and constancy.</p>

<p>Though it was very late, I found a silent group of four
nurses standing in the heavily shadowed street before the
shut doors of this small civilian hospital; they were still
staring up fixedly at the silver-bright sky. They proved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
to be day-nurses off duty, and among them was Mademoiselle
Annette. She greeted me now as an old friend, and
brushing rules and regulations aside like a true Frenchwoman
took me at once to Susan. I found that Susan had
risen from bed and was seated at her window, which looked
out across the winter-bare hospital garden.</p>

<p>"Ambo," she exclaimed impatiently, "why did you come
here! I'm so used to all this. But Jeanne-Marie, Ambo&mdash;in
her condition! I've been hoping so you would think
of her&mdash;go to her!"</p>

<p>Then what fatuous devil&mdash;was it my old familiar demon?&mdash;put
it into my heart to say: "So you haven't been
worrying, dear, about me?"</p>

<p>"About you!" she cried. "Good God, no! What does
it matter about you&mdash;or me! This generation's done for,
Ambo. Only the children count now&mdash;the children. We
must save them&mdash;all of them&mdash;somehow. It's up to them&mdash;to
Jimmy's son with the rest! They've got to wipe us out,
clear the slate of us and all our insanities! They've got
to pass over the wreck of us and rebuild a happy, intelligible
world!"</p>

<p>She rose, seized my arm, and summoning all her strength
thrust me from her toward the door.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>It was well on toward three o'clock in the morning when
at last I stood before the black, close-shuttered shop-front
of the Vve. Guyot. I was desperately weary, having of
necessity walked all the way. It was, as I had fully realized
while almost stumbling along toward my goal, a crazy
errand. I should find a dark, silent house, and I should
then stumble back through dark, silent streets to my dark,
silent hotel. The shop of the Widow Guyot was a very
little shop on a very narrow street, a mere slit between
high, ancient buildings&mdash;a slit filled now with the dense
river-mist that shrouds from the experience of Parisians
all the renewing wonders of clear-eyed dawn. The moon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
had set, or else hung too veiled and low for this pestilent
alley; in spite of a thick military overcoat I shivered with
cold; the flat, sour smell of ill-flushed gutters caught at
my throat. To this abomination of desolation I had, with
no little difficulty, found my way. Thank God I could
turn now, with a good conscience, and fumble back to the
warm oblivion of bed.</p>

<p>I paused a moment, however, to draw up the collar of
my overcoat to my ears and fasten it securely; and, doing
so, I was aware of the scrape and clink of metal on metal;
then the shop-door right before me was shaken and jarred
open from within. The fluttering rays of a candle, tremulously
held, surprised and for an instant blinded me;
faintly luminous green and red balloons wheeled swiftly
in contracting circles, then coalesced to a flickering point
of light. The candle was held by an old, stout woman with
a loose-jowled, bruised-looking face; a face somehow sensual
and hard in spite of its bloated antiquity. A shrunken,
thin-bearded man in a long black coat stood beside her,
holding a black hand-bag. The two were conversing in
tones deliberately muted, but broke off and stared outward
as the candle-light discovered me in the narrow street.</p>

<p>"Ah, M'sieu, one sees, is American; he has perhaps lost
his way?" piped the thin-bearded man, pretty sharply.
He, too, was old.</p>

<p>"But no," I replied; "I am here precisely on behalf of
my friend, Lieutenant Kane."</p>

<p>At this name the old woman began, only to check, a
half-startled squawk, lifting her candle as she did so and
peering more intently at me. "At this hour, m'sieu?" she
demanded huskily. "What could bring you at such an
hour?"</p>

<p>"Do I address the Widow Guyot?" I was quick to
respond.</p>

<p>"<i>Oui, m'sieu.</i>"</p>

<p>"Then, permit me to explain." As briefly as possible
I told her who I was; that I had but very recently learned
of the presence of Jimmy's wife in Paris, with a relative&mdash;learned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
that she was awaiting the birth of her first child
at the house of this excellent woman. "It was my intention
to call soon, madame, in any case, and make myself
known&mdash;feeling there might prove to be many little services
a friend would be only too happy to render. But,
after this terrible raid, I found it impossible to retire with
an easy mind&mdash;at least, until I had assured myself that
all was well with you here."</p>

<p>On this there came a pause, and the thin-bearded man
cleared his throat diligently several times.</p>

<p>"The truth is, m'sieu," he finally hazarded, "that your
apprehension was only too just. You arrive at a house of
mourning, m'sieu. You arrive, as I did, alas&mdash;too late!
This poor Madame Kane you would inquire for is dead.
The child, on the contrary, still lives."</p>

<p>"Enter, m'sieu," said the Widow Guyot. "We can discuss
these things more commodiously within. Doubtless,
otherwise, we shall receive attentions from the police; they
are nervous to-night. Naturally." She seemed, I thought&mdash;in
the utter blank depression which had seized me with
the doctor's words&mdash;offensively calm. Whether, had a
doctor been more quickly obtainable, or a more skillful
practitioner at last obtained, little Jeanne-Marie's life
might have been spared, I am unable to say. I feel certain,
however, that the Widow Guyot&mdash;under difficult, not to
say terrifying circumstances&mdash;had kept a cool head, done
her best. I exonerate her from all blame. But I add this:
Never in my life have I met elsewhere a woman who seemed
to me to possess such cold-blooded possibilities for evil.
Yet, so far as I know to this hour, her life has always been
and now continues industrious and thrifty; harmless before
the law. I have absolutely "nothing on her"&mdash;nothing but
an impression I shall never be rid of, which even now
returns to chill me in nights of insomnia: a sense of having
met in life one woman whose eyes may now and then have
watered from dust or wind, but could never under any
circumstances conceivably human have known tears. Other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
women, too many of them, have bored or exasperated me
with maudlin or trivial tears; but never before or since
have I met a woman who <i>could</i> not weep. It is a fixed
idea with me that the Widow Guyot could not; and the
idea haunts and troubles me strangely&mdash;though why it
should, I am too casual a psychologist even to guess.</p>

<p>At her heels, I crossed a small cluttered shop, following
the tremulous flame of the candle through a fantastic
shadow dance; Doctor Pollain&mdash;who had given me his name
with the deprecating cough of one who knows himself
either unpleasantly notorious or hopelessly obscure&mdash;shuffled
behind us. Madame Guyot opened an inner door.
Light from the room beyond tempered a little the vagueness
about me and ghostily revealed a huddle of ecclesiastical
trumpery&mdash;rows of thin, pale-yellow tapers; small
crucifixes of plaster or base-metal gilded; a stand of picture
post-cards; a table littered with lesser gimcracks. The
direct rays from Madame Guyot's candle, as she turned a
moment in the doorway, wanly illuminated the blue-coiffed,
vapid face of a bisque Virgin; gave for that instant a half-flicker,
as of just-stirring life, to her mannered, meaningless
smile.</p>

<p>The room beyond proved to be a good-sized bedroom,
its one window muffled by heavy stuff-curtains of a dull
magenta red. A choking, composite odor&mdash;I detected
the sick pungency of chloroform&mdash;emerged from it. I
plunged to enter, and for a second instinctively held my
breath. On the great walnut double-bed lay a still figure
covered with a sheet; the proper candles twinkled at head
and foot. But it is needless to describe these things.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>It was in a smaller room beyond, a combined living-and-dining
room, stodgily ugly, but comfortable enough as
well, that I first made the acquaintance of James Aulard
Kane. What I saw was a great roll of blankets in a deep
boxlike cradle, and in the depths of a deeply dented feather
pillow a tiny, wrinkled monkey-face, a miniature grotesque.
The small knife-slit that served him for mouth opened and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
shut slowly and continuously, as if feebly gasping for difficult
breath. He gave not even one faint encouraging cry.
I turned to Doctor Pollain, shaking my head.</p>

<p>"But no!" he exclaimed. "For an eight-months child,
look you&mdash;he has vigor! I am sure he will live."</p>

<p>"Then, for his father's sake," I replied, "we must take
no chances! Isn't there a maternity hospital in the neighborhood
where he can receive the close attention that you,
madame, at your age, with your responsibilities, ought not
to be expected to give? I make myself fully responsible
for any and all charges involved. Understand me, madame,
and you, M. le M&eacute;decin, I insist that no stone shall be left
unturned!"</p>

<p>These words produced, at once a grateful change in the
atmosphere&mdash;hitherto, I had felt, ever so slightly hostile.
It is unnecessary to follow our further negotiations to their
entirely amicable close. Half an hour later I left the shop
of the Widow Guyot, satisfied that Doctor Pollain would
assist her to make all needful arrangements, and promising
to get into communication as soon as it could be managed
with "M. Jee-mee." I should return, I told them, certainly,
before noon.</p>

<p>But for Jimmy's sake, on leaving, I raised a corner of
the sheet covering the face of Jeanne-Marie. It was a
peaceful face. If she had lately suffered, death now had
quietly smoothed from her all but a lasting restfulness.
A good little woman, I mused, of the best type provincial
France offers; sensible, yet ardent; practical, yet kind.
As I looked down at her, the meaningless smile of the
bisque Madonna in the shop without returned to me, simpered
for a half-second before me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The symbols men
made&mdash;and sold&mdash;commercial symbols! The Mother of Sorrows,
a Chinese toy! Well.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"One thing troubles me," said the Widow Guyot at my
elbow, in her husky, passionless voice: "She did not receive
the last rites, m'sieu. When the bad turn came, it was
not possible for us to leave her. You will understand that.
There was a new life, was there not? Assuredly, though,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
I am troubled; I regret that this should have happened to
<i>me</i>. It will be a great cause for scandal, m'sieu&mdash;when you
consider my connections&mdash;the nature of my little affairs.
But, name of God, that will pass; one explains these things
with a certain success, and my age favors me. I bear, God
be praised, a good name; and in the proper quarters,
m'sieu. But&mdash;the poor little one! Observe m'sieu, that
she clasps a crucifix on her breast. Be so good as to
remember that I placed it in her hands&mdash;an instant before
she died."</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>It is an artistic fault in real life that it deals so frequently
in coincidence, to the casting of suspicion upon
those who report it veraciously. On the very night that
Jeanne-Marie died, probably within the very hour that she
died, Jimmy was shot down, while taking part in a bombing
expedition; the plane he was conducting was seen, by
crews of the two other bombing-<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'plans'">planes</ins> in the formation, to
burst into flames after a direct hit from an anti-aircraft
battery, which had been firing persistently, though necessarily
at haphazard, up toward the bumble-bee hum of
French motors&mdash;so betrayingly unlike the irregular guttural
growl of the German machines.</p>

<p>Throughout the following morning I had been attempting,
with the indispensable aid of my old friend, Colonel &mdash;&mdash;,
of the French war office, to get into telegraphic communication
with the commander of Jimmy's <i>esquadrille;</i>
but it was noon, or very nearly, before this unexpected
word came to us. And when it came, I found myself unable
to believe it.</p>

<p>In the very spirit of Assessor Brack, "Things don't
happen like that!" I kept insisting. "It's too improbable.
I must wait for further verification. We shall see, colonel,
there's been an error in names; some mistake." I was
stubborn about it. Simply, for Susan's sake, I could not
admit the possibility that Jimmy was dead.</p>

<p>During the midday pause I hurriedly made my way to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the Widow Guyot's little shop. The baby had already
been taken to the Hospice de la Maternit&eacute;&mdash;the old Convent
of Port Royal, near the cemetery of Montparnasse.
He had stood the trip well, Madame Guyot assured me,
and would undoubtedly win through to a ripe old age. A
priest was present. I told Madame Guyot to arrange with
him for a proper funeral and interment for Jeanne-Marie,
and was at once informed that the skilled assistants of a
local director of <i>pompes fun&eacute;bres</i> were even then at work,
embalming her mortal remains.</p>

<p>"So much, at least, m'sieu," said Madame Guyot, "I
knew her husband would desire; and I relied on your suggestion
that no expense need be spared. I have stipulated
for a funeral of the first class"&mdash;a specific thing in France;
so many carriages with black horses, so many plumes of
such a quality, and so on&mdash;"it only remains to acquire a
site for the poor little one's grave. This, too, M'sieu le
Capitaine, you may safely leave to my discretion; but we
must together fix on a day and hour for the ceremonies.
Is it yet known when this poor Lieutenant Kane will
arrive in Paris?"</p>

<p>No, it was not yet known; I should be able to inform her,
I hazarded, before nightfall; and I thanked her for the
pains she was taking, and again assured her that the financial
question was of no importance. As I said this, the
priest, a dry wisp of manhood, softly drew nearer and
slightly moistened his thin-set lips; but he did not speak.
Possibly Madame Guyot spoke for him.</p>

<p>"At such times, m'sieu," she replied, "one does what
one can. But naturally&mdash;that is understood. One is not
an only relative for nothing, m'sieu. The heart speaks.
True, I have hitherto been put to certain expenses for
which the poor little one had promised to reimburse
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I hastened to assure her that she had only to present
this account to me in full, and we parted with mutual
though secret contempt, and with every sanctified expression<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of esteem. Then I returned to the cabinet of my
friend, Colonel &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>By three o'clock in the afternoon a brief telegram from
Jimmy's commander was brought to us; it removed every
possibility of doubt, even from my obdurate mind. Jimmy
had "gone West" once for all, and this time "West" was
not even a geographical expression.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I sat silent for
perhaps five slowly passing minutes in the presence of
Colonel &mdash;&mdash;, until I was aware of a somewhat amazed
scrutiny from tired, heavily pouched blue eyes.</p>

<p>"You feel this deeply," he observed, "and I&mdash;I feel
nothing, except a vague sympathy for you, <i>mon ami</i>.
Accept, without phrases, I beg you, all that a sad old man
has left to give."</p>

<p>I rose, thanked him warmly for the trouble he had taken
on my behalf, and left him to his endless, disheartening
labors. France was in danger; he knew that France was
in danger. What to him, in those days, was one young
life more or less? He himself had lost three sons in the
war.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>But how was I to let fall this one blow more, this
heaviest blow of all, upon Susan? It was that which had
held me silent in my chair, inhibiting all will to rise and
begin the next needful step. Yes, it was that; I was thinking
of Susan, not of Jimmy. For me in those days, I fear,
the world consisted of Susan, and of certain negligible
phantoms&mdash;the remainder of the human race. It is not an
<i>&eacute;tat d'&acirc;me</i> that Susan admires, or that I much admire;
but in those days it was certainly mine. And this is the
worst of a lonely passion: the more one loves in secret,
without fulfillment&mdash;and however unselfishly&mdash;the more
one excludes. Life contracts to a vivid, hypnotizing point;
all else is shadow. In the name of our common humanity,
there is a good deal to be said for those who are fickle or
frankly pagan, who love more lightly, and more easily
forget. But enough of all this! Phil with his steady
wisdom might philosophize it to some purpose; not I.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>In my uncertainty of mind, then, the first step that I
took was an absurdly false one. There was just one thing
for me to do, and I did not do it. I should have gone
straight to Susan and told her about Jimmy and Jeanne-Marie;
above all, about James Aulard Kane. Even if
Susan, as I then supposed, loved Jimmy, and had always
loved him&mdash;knowing her as I did, loving her as I did, I
should have felt instinctively that this was the one wise
and kind, the one possible thing to do. Yet a sudden weakness,
born of innate cowardice, betrayed me.</p>

<p>I went, instead, direct to the Hotel Crillon and sent up
my card to Miss Leslie; it struck me as fortunate that I
found her just returned to her rooms from a visit to Susan.
It was really a calamity. I had seen her several times
there, at the hospital; I liked her; and I knew that Susan
had now no more devoted friend. She received me cordially,
and I at once laid all the facts before her and&mdash;with
an entirely sincere humbleness&mdash;asked her advice.
But God, in the infinite variety of his creations, had never
intended Mona Leslie to shine by reason of insight or
common sense; she had other qualities! And this, too, I
should easily have discerned. Why I did not, can only
be explained by a sort of prostration of all my faculties,
which had come upon me with the events of the night and
morning just past. I was inert, body and soul; I could
not think; I felt like a child in the sweep of dark forces
it cannot struggle against and does not understand; in
effect, I was for the time being a stricken, credulous child.
Perhaps no grown man, not definitely insane, has ever
touched a lower stratum of spiritual debility than I then
sank to&mdash;resting there, grateful, fatuously content, as if on
firm ground. In short, I was a plain and self-damned fool.</p>

<p>It seemed to me, I remember, during our hour's talk
together, that Miss Leslie was one of the two or three
wisest, most understanding, and sympathetic persons I had
ever met. Sympathetic, she genuinely was; very gracious
and interestingly melancholy, in her Belgian nurse's costume,
with King Albert's decoration pinned to her breast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
It seemed to me that she divined my thoughts before I
uttered them; as perhaps she did&mdash;for to call them thoughts
is to dignify vague sensations with a misleading name.
Miss Leslie had had always, I am now aware, an instinctive
response for vague sensations; she had always vibrated to
them like a harp, thus surrounding herself with an odd,
whispering music. A strange woman; not without nobility
and force when the appropriate vague sensations played
upon her. The sufferings of war had already wrung from
her a wild, &aelig;olian masterpiece, more moving perhaps than
a consciously ordered symphony. And Susan, though she
had never so much as guessed at Susan, was one of her
passions! Susan played on us both that day: though the
mawkish music we made would have disgusted her&mdash;did
disgust her in its final effects, as it has finally disgusted
me.</p>

<p>What these effects were can be briefly told, but not
briefly enough to comfort me. There is no second page of
this record I should be so happy not to write.</p>

<p>Miss Leslie had long suspected, she told me, that Susan&mdash;like
Viola's hypothetical sister&mdash;was pining in thought
for a secret, unkind lover, and she at once accepted as a
certainty my suggestion that so gallant a young aviator
as Jimmy had been what "glorious Jane" always calls her
"object."</p>

<p>"This must be kept from her, Mr. Hunt, at all costs&mdash;for
the next few weeks, I mean! She's simply not strong
enough yet, not poised enough, to bear it&mdash;with all the
rest! It would be cruelty to tell her now, and might prove
murderous. Oh, believe me, Mr. Hunt&mdash;I <i>know!</i>"</p>

<p>Her cocksure intensity could not fail to impress me in
my present state of deadness; I listened as if to oracles.
Then we conspired together.</p>

<p>"My lease of the villa at Mentone runs on till May,"
said Miss Leslie. "Susan's physically able for the journey
now, I think; we must take that risk anyway. I'll get the
doctors to order her down there with me, at once. She
needs the change, the peace; above all&mdash;the <i>beauty</i> of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
She's starved for beauty, poor soul! And there's the possibility
of further raids, too; she mustn't in her condition
be exposed to that. When she's stronger, Mr. Hunt&mdash;after
she's had a few happy weeks&mdash;then I'll tell her everything,
in my own way. Women can do these things, you know;
they have an instinct for the right moment, the right
words."</p>

<p>"You are proving that now," I said. Every word she had
spoken was balm to me. Everything could be put off&mdash;put
off.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To put things off indefinitely, hide them out of
sight, dodge them somehow! Why, she was voicing the one
weary cry of my soul!</p>

<p>And so, within three days, this supreme folly was accomplished.
Mona Leslie and I stole across the river in secret
to little Jeanne-Marie's meagerly attended "funeral of the
first class," and with Madame Guyot, Doctor Pollain, and
a few casual neighbors, we followed her coffin from the
vast drafty dreariness of St. Sulpice to the wintry, crowded
alleys of the cemetery of Montparnasse.&mdash;That very evening
Susan left with Miss Leslie for Mentone.</p>

<p>She was glad enough to go, she said, for a week or two.
"But Ambo&mdash;what shall I say to Jimmy? Will he ever
forgive me for not having been able to make friends, first,
with Jeanne-Marie? And it's all your fault, dear; you
must tell him that&mdash;say you've been downright cross with
me about it. I wish now I hadn't listened to you; I feel
perfectly well to-night; I've no business to be starting on
a holiday. But I shan't stay long, Ambo. I'll be back
in Paris before little Jimmy arrives; I promise you that.
And here's a letter to post, dear; I've said so in it to
Jeanne-Marie."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A dark train drew out of a dark station. With it went
Hope, the shadow, silently, from my heart.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>The days passed. Mentone, Miss Leslie wrote me, was
doing everything for Susan that we had desired. "But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
she is determined," she added, "to be back in Paris by the
last week of February&mdash;when the baby was expected. She
begins to be bothered that you write so scrappily and
vaguely, and that she hears nothing directly from Lieutenant
Kane or Jeanne-Marie. I shall have to tell her soon
now, in any case. It seems more difficult as I come nearer
to it, but I still feel sure we have done the right thing.
I'm certain now that Susan will be able to face and bear it.
Already she's full of plans for the future&mdash;wonderful!
Possibly, if an opportunity offers, I shall tell her to-night."</p>

<p>The next afternoon my telephone rang. When I answered
it, Susan spoke to me. "Ambo," she said, "I'm at the
France-et-Choiseul. Please come over at once, no matter
how busy you are. You owe that much to me, I think."
She had hung up the receiver before I could stammer a
reply.</p>

<p>But nothing more was necessary. I went to her as a
criminal goes to confession, knowing at last how hideously
in her eyes I had sinned.</p>

<p>"You <i>meant</i> well, Ambo," she said with a gentleness
that yielded nothing&mdash;"you and Mona. Meaning well's
what I feel now I can never quite forgive you. <i>You</i>, Ambo.
Poor Mona doesn't count in this. But you&mdash;I thought I
was safe with you. No matter."</p>

<p>Later she said: "I've seen Madame Guyot&mdash;a horrible
woman; and the baby. He's a nice baby. You did just
right about him, Ambo. Thank you for that." She mused
a moment. "I suppose it's absurd to think he looks like
Jimmy? But to me he does. I'm going to adopt him,
Ambo. You see"&mdash;her smile was wistful&mdash;"I <i>am</i> going to
have a baby of my own, after all."</p>

<p>"I'd thought of adopting him, myself," I babbled; "but
of course&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Susan.</p>

<p>In so many subtle ways she had made it clear to me. I
had disappointed her; revealed a blindness, a weakness,
she would never be able to forget. In my hotel room that
night I faced it out and accepted my punishment as just.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Just&mdash;but terrible.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There is nothing in life so terrible
as to know oneself utterly and finally alone.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>On the night of the eighth of March the Gothas, so long
expected, returned; to be met this time by a persistent
<i>barrage</i> fire from massed 75's, which proved, however, little
more than the good beginnings of a really competent
defense. Many bombs fell within the fortifications, and we
who dwelt there needed no other proof that the problem
of the defense of Paris against air raids had not yet successfully
been solved.</p>

<p>There were thickening rumors, too, of an imminent German
attack in force. Things were not going well at the
Front. It was common gossip that there was division
among the Allies; the British and French commands were
pulling at cross purposes; Italy seemed impotent; Russia
had collapsed; the Americans were unknown factors, and
slow to arrive. It began to seem possible&mdash;to the disaffected
or naturally pessimistic, more than possible&mdash;that the Prussian
mountebank might make good his anachronistic boast
to wear down and conquer the world.</p>

<p>Even the weather seemed to fight for his pinchbeck
empire; it was continuously dry, and for the season in
Northern France extraordinarily clear. By its painful
contrast with our common anxieties, the unseasonable
beauty of those March days and nights weighted as if with
lead the sense of threat, of impending calamity, that
pressed upon us and chilled us and made desperate our
hearts.</p>

<p>I saw Susan daily. She did not avoid me and was never
unkind, but I felt that she took little comfort or pleasure
from my society. Mona Leslie, rather huffed than chastened,
I fear, by Susan's quiet aloofness, had returned to
her duties at Dunkirk. I was glad to have her go, to be
rid of the embarrassment of her explanations and counsel&mdash;to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
be rid, above all, of the pointedly sympathetic and pitying
pressure of her hand. Except for a slight limp, Susan
now got about freely and was busily engaged with our Red
Cross directors on plans for a nursing-home for the children
of repatriated refugees&mdash;a home where these little victims
of frightfulness and malnutrition could be built up again
into happy soundness of body and mind, into the vigorous
life-stuff needed for the future of France and of the world.
A too-medieval ch&acirc;teau at &mdash;&mdash;, in Provence, had been
offered; and plans for its immediate alteration and modernization
were being drawn.</p>

<p>The whole thing, from the first, had been Susan's idea,
and she was to have charge of it all&mdash;once the required
plant was ready&mdash;as became its creator. But indeed, in the
interim, she had simply taken charge of our Red Cross
architects and buyers and builders and engineers, and was
sweeping things forward with a tactful but exceedingly
high hand. She meant that the interim should be, if possible,
brief.</p>

<p>"I want results," said Susan; "we can discuss the rules
we've broken afterward. The children are fading out <i>now</i>,
and some of them will be dead or hopelessly withered before
we can aid them. Let's get some kind of home and get it
running; with a couple of good doctors, an orthopedist, a
dental expert, and the right nurses&mdash;and I'll pick <i>them</i>,
please!&mdash;we can make out somehow, 'most anywhere."</p>

<p>There was no standing against her. It was presently
plain to all of us in the Paris headquarters that this nursing
home was to be put through, in record time, Germans
or no Germans, and no matter who fell by the wayside!
And, in spite of my natural anxiety, I was soon convinced
that whoever fell, it would not be Susan&mdash;not, at least,
till the clear flame of her spirit had burned out the oil of
her energy to its last granted drop.</p>

<p>In the rare intervals of these labors, she was arranging
for the legal adoption of James Aulard Kane. No step of
this kind is easily arranged in bureaucratic France. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
a difficult land to be legally born in or married in, or to
die in&mdash;if one wishes to do these things, at least, with a
certain decency, <i>en r&egrave;gle</i>.</p>

<p>Susan complained to me of this, wittily scornful, as we
left the Red Cross headquarters together on the evening
of March eleventh, and started toward her hotel down the
dusky colonnade of the Rue de Rivoli.</p>

<p>"I'm worn out with them all!" she exclaimed. "All I
want is to take care of Jimmy's baby, and you'd think I
was plotting to upset the government. I shall, too, if some
of these French officials don't presently exhibit more common
sense. It <i>ought</i> to be upset&mdash;and simplified. Oh, I
wish I lived in a woman's republic, Ambo! Things would
happen there, even if they were wrong! No woman has
patience enough to be bureaucratic."</p>

<p>"True," I chimed; "and you're right about men, all
round. We're hopeless incompetents at statecraft and such
things, at running a reasonable world&mdash;but we <i>can</i> cook!
And what you need for a change from all this is a good
dinner&mdash;a real dinner! It will renew your faith in the
eternal masculine&mdash;and we haven't had a bat, Susan, or
talked nonsense, for years and years! Come on, dear!
Let's have a perfectly shameless bat to-night and damn
the consequences! What do you say?"</p>

<p>"I say&mdash;damn the consequences, Ambo! Let's! Why,
I'd forgotten there was such a thing as a bat left in the
world!"</p>

<p>"But there is! Look&mdash;there's even a taxi to begin on!"</p>

<p>I hailed it; I even secured it; and we were presently
clanking and grinding on our way&mdash;in what must have
been an authentic relic from the First Battle of the Marne&mdash;toward
the one restaurant in Paris. Unto each man,
native or alien, who knows his Paris, God grants but one,
though it is never the same. Well, I make no secret about
it; my passion is deep and openly proclaimed. For me,
the one restaurant in Paris is <i>Lap&eacute;rouse;</i> I am long past
discussing the claims of rivals. It is&mdash;simply and finally&mdash;<i>Lap&eacute;rouse</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>We descended before an ancient, dingy building on the
Quai des Grands-Augustins, passed through a cramped
doorway into a tiny, ill-lit foyer, climbed a steep narrow
stairs, and were presently installed in a corner of the small
corner dining-room, with our backs neighborly against the
wall. In this room there happened that night to be but
one other diner; a small, bloated, bullet-headed civilian,
with prominent staring eyes; a man of uncertain age, but
nearing fifty at a guess. We paid little attention to him
at first, though it soon became evident to us that he was
enjoying a Pantagruelian banquet in lonely state, deliberately
gorging himself with the richest and most incongruously
varied food. <i>Comme boissons</i>, he had always before
him two bottles, one of <i>Ch&acirc;teau Yquem</i> and one of <i>Fine
Champagne;</i> and he alternated gulps of thick yellow sweetness
with drams of neat brandy. Neither seemed to produce
upon him any perceptible effect, though he emitted
from time to time moist porcine snufflings of fleshy satisfaction.
Rather a disgusting little man, we decided; and
so dismissed him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>To the ordering of our own dinner I gave a finicky care
which greatly amused Susan, for whom food, I regret to
say, has always remained an indifferent matter; it is the
one &aelig;sthetic flaw in her otherwise so delicately organized
being. In spite of every effort on my part to educate her
palate, five or six nibbles at almost anything edible remains
her idea of a banquet&mdash;provided the incidental talk prove
sufficiently companionable or stimulating.</p>

<p>That night, however, do what we would, our talk
together was neither precisely the one nor the other. We
both, rather desperately, I think, made a supreme effort
to approximate the free affectionate chatter of old days;
but such things never come of premeditation, and there
were ghosts at the table with us. It would not work.</p>

<p>"Oh, what's the use, Ambo!" Susan finally exclaimed,
with a weary sigh. "We can't do it this way! Sister's
here, and Jeanne-Marie&mdash;as close to me as if I had seen
her and known her always; and maybe&mdash;Phil. But Jimmy's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
here most of all! There's no use pretending we're forgetting,
when we're not. You and I aren't built for forgetting,
Ambo. We'll never forget."</p>

<p>"No, dear; we'll never forget."</p>

<p>"Let's <i>remember</i>, then," said Susan; "remember all we
can."</p>

<p>For a long hour thereafter we rather mused together
than conversed. Constraint slipped from us, as those we
had best loved came back to us, warm and near and living
in our thoughts of them. No taint of false sentiment, of
sorrow willfully indulged, marred these memories. Trying
to be happy we had failed; now, strangely, we came near
to joy.</p>

<p>"We haven't lost them!" exclaimed Susan. "Not any
part of them; we never can."</p>

<p>"They haven't lost us, then?"</p>

<p>"No"&mdash;she pondered it&mdash;"they haven't lost us."</p>

<p>"You mean it, Susan&mdash;literally? You believe they still
live&mdash;<i>out there?</i>"</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Poor Ambo," murmured Susan; then, with a quick,
dancing gleam: "But as Jimmy'd say, dear, you can just
take it from <i>me!</i>"</p>

<p>She spoke of him as if present beside her. A silence fell
between us and deepened.</p>

<p>The small, bullet-headed man had just paid his extravagant
bill, distributed his largesse, and was about to depart.
He was being helped into a sumptuous overcoat, with a
deep collar of what I took to be genuine Russian sables.
There was nothing in his officiously tended leave-taking to
stir my interest; my eyes rested on him idly for a moment,
that was all. The head waiter, two under-waiters, and a
solemn little buttons followed him out to the stair-head,
with every expression of gratitude and esteem. Passing
from sight, he passed from my thoughts, leaving with me
only a vague physical repulsion that barely outlasted his
departure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you know what I think Phil has done?" Susan was
asking.</p>

<p>"Phil?" The name had startled me back to attention.</p>

<p>"I believe he's made himself one of them&mdash;the peasants,
I mean&mdash;in some remote, dirty, half-starved Russian village."</p>

<p>"Why? That's an odd fancy, dear. And it isn't much
like him. Phil's too clear-headed, or stiff-headed, for such
mysticism."</p>

<p>"How little you really know him, then," she replied.
"He's been steering since birth, I feel, toward some great
final renunciation. I believe he's made it, now. You'll
see, Ambo. Some day we'll hear of a new prophet, away
there in the East&mdash;where all our living dreams come from!
You'll see!"</p>

<p>"'In Vishnu-land what Avatar?'" I quoted, smiling
sadly enough; and Susan's smile wistfully echoed mine,
even while she raised a warning finger at me.</p>

<p>"Oh, you of little faith!" she said quite simply.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>We had barely stepped out from the narrow doorway of
the restaurant into a tenuous, moon-saturated mist, a low-lying
diaphaneity that left the upper air-lanes openly clear,
when the sirens were wailing again from every quarter of
the city.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"They're coming early to-night!" I exclaimed. "Well,
that ends all hope for a taxi home! We must find an <i>abri</i>."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! We'll walk quietly back along the river.
Unless"&mdash;she teased me&mdash;"you really <i>are</i> afraid, Ambo?"</p>

<p>I tucked her arm firmly into mine. "So you won't stumble,
<i>Mlle. la R&eacute;form&eacute;e!</i>"</p>

<p>"But it is a nuisance to be lame!" she protested: "I do
envy you your two good legs, <i>M. le Capitaine</i>."</p>

<p>We made our way slowly along the embankment, passing
the Pont des Arts, and two shadowy lovers paced on
before us, blotted together, oblivious of the long, eerie rise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
and fall of the sirens; every twenty yards or so they
stopped in their tracks, as by a common impulsion, and
were momentarily lost to time in a passionate embrace.</p>

<p>Neither Susan nor I spoke of these lovers, who turned
aside to pass under the black arches of the Institute, into
the Rue de Seine.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>As we neared the Pont du Carrousel the <i>barrage</i> began,
at first distant and muffled&mdash;the outer guns; then suddenly
and grimly nearer. An incessant twinkle of tiny star-white
points&mdash;the bursts of high-explosive shells&mdash;drifted toward
us from the north. So light was the mist, it did not obscure
them; it barely dimmed the moon.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" I said, checking Susan; "this is something
new! They're firing to-night straight across Paris." The
glitter of star-points seemed in a moment to fill all the
northern sky; the noise of the <i>barrage</i> trebled, trebled
again.</p>

<p>"Why, it's drum fire!" cried Susan. "Oh, how
beautiful!"</p>

<p>"Yes; but we'll get on faster, all the same! I'll help
you! Come!"</p>

<p>I put my arm firmly about her waist and almost lifted
her along with me. By the time we had reached the Pont
Royal, the high-explosive bursts were directly over us;
the air rocked with them. I detected, too, at intervals,
another more ominous sound&mdash;that deep, pulsing growl
which no one having once heard it could ever mistake.</p>

<p>"Gothas," I growled back at them, "flying low. They've
ducked under the guns!"</p>

<p>And instantly I swung Susan across the open <i>quai</i> to the
left and plunged with her up an inky defile, the Rue du Bac.</p>

<p>"Where are you taking me?" she demanded, half breathless,
dragging against my arm.</p>

<p>"To the first available <i>abri</i>," I cried at her, under the
sky's reckless tumult. "Don't stop to argue about it!"</p>

<p>But she halted me right by the corner of the Rue de
Lille. "If it's going to be a bad raid, Ambo, I must get
to Jimmy's baby&mdash;I <i>must!</i>"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"Impossible! It's at least two miles&mdash;and this isn't
going to be a picnic, Susan! You're coming with <i>me!</i>"
I tightened my arm about her; every instant now I expected
the shattering climax of the bombs.</p>

<p>Then, just as we crossed the Rue de Lille, something
halted me in my turn. About a hundred yards at my
right, down toward the Gare D'Orsay, and from the very
middle of the black street-chasm, a keen, bladelike ray
of light flashed once and again&mdash;sharp, vertical rapier-thrusts&mdash;straight
up through the thin mist-veil into the
treacherous sky. Followed, doubtless from a darkened upper
window, a woman's frantic shriek: "<i>Espion&mdash;espion!</i>"</p>

<p>Pistol shots next&mdash;and rough cries&mdash;and a pounding
charge of feet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Right into my arms he floundered, and
I tackled him and fell with him to the cobbles and fought
him there blindly, feeling for his throat. This lasted but
a moment. Gendarmes tore us apart, in a brief crossing
flash of electric-torches&mdash;and I caught just one glimpse of
a bare bullet-head, of a bloated, discolored face, of prominent
staring eyes, maddened by fear. There could be no
mistake. It was our little man of the Pantagruelian banquet.
We had watched him eating his last fabulous meal&mdash;his
farewell to Egypt.</p>

<p>And that is all I just then clearly remember.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am
told that nine bombs fell in a sweeping circle throughout
this district; one of them, in the very courtyard of the
War Office; one of them&mdash;of 300 kilos&mdash;perhaps a square
from where we stood. There was a rush past of hurtling
fragments&mdash;glass, chimney-tiles, chips of masonry, <i>que
sais-je?</i>&mdash;and even this I report only because I have been
credibly so informed.</p>

<p>What next I experienced was pain, unlocalized at first,
yet somehow damnably concentrated: pure, white-hot essence
of pain. And through the stiff hell of it I was, and
was not, aware of someone&mdash;some one&mdash;some <i>one</i>&mdash;murmuring
love and pity and mortal anguish.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"Ambo&mdash;you wouldn't leave me&mdash;not you! Not you,
Ambo&mdash;not alone.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>The pain dimmed off from me in an ebbing, dull-red
wave; great coils of palpable darkness swirled down upon
me to smother me; I struggled to rise from beneath them&mdash;fling
them off.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. From an infinite distance, a woman's
cry threaded through them, like a needle through mufflings
of wool, and pricked me to an instant, a single instant,
of clear consciousness. I opened my eyes on Susan's; I
strove to answer them, tell her I understood. Susan says
that I did answer them&mdash;that I even smiled. But I can
feel back now only to a vast sinking away, depth under
depth under depth, down&mdash;down&mdash;down&mdash;down.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>The rest, however, I thank God, is not yet silence; though
it is high time to make an end of this long and all too
faulty record.</p>

<p>They did various things to me at the hospital, from time
to time; they removed hard substances from me that were
distinctly out of place in my interior; they also removed
certain portions of my authentic anatomy&mdash;three fingers of
my left hand, among others, and my left leg to the knee.
This was not in itself agreeable, and I shall always regret
their loss; yet those weeks of progressive operation and
tardy recuperation were, up to that period, the happiest,
the most fulfilled weeks of my life. And surely egotism
can go no farther! For these weeks of my triumphant happiness
were altogether the darkest, saddest, cruellest weeks
of the war. In a world without light, my heart sang in
my breast, sang hallelujahs, and would not be cast down.
Susan loved me&mdash;<i>me</i>&mdash;had always loved me! Rheims soon
might fall, Amiens might fall, the channel ports, Paris,
London, the Seven Seas&mdash;the World! What did it matter!
Susan loved me&mdash;loved me!</p>

<p>And even now&mdash;though Susan is ashamed for me that I
can say it&mdash;though I feel that I ought to be ashamed that
I can say it&mdash;though I wonder that I am not&mdash;though I
try to be&mdash;well, I am <i>not</i> ashamed!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Final Note, by Susan&mdash;<i>insisted upon:</i> "But all the same,
secretly, he is ashamed. For there's nobody in the world
like Ambo, whether for dearness or general absurdity.
Why shouldn't he have been a little happy, if he could
manage it, throughout those interminable weeks of physical
pain? He suffered day and night, preferring not to
be kept under morphine too constantly. I won't say he
was a hero; he <i>was</i>, but there's nothing to be puffed up
about nowadays in that. If the war has proved anything,
it is that in nearly every man, when his particular form
of Zero Hour sounds for him, some kind of a self-despising
hero is waiting, and ready to act or endure or be broken
and cast away. We all know that now. It's the cornerstone
for a possible Utopia: no, it's more than that&mdash;it's
the whole foundation. But I didn't mean to say so when
I started this note.</p>

<p>"All I meant to say was that you must never take
Ambo <i>au pied de la lettre</i>. I'm not in the least as he's
hymned me&mdash;but that, surely, you've guessed between the
lines. What is much more important is that he's not in
the least as he has painted himself. But unless I were
to rewrite his whole book for him&mdash;which wouldn't be
tactful in an otherwise spoiled and contented wife&mdash;I could
never make this clear, or do my strange, too sensitive man
the full justice he deserves. He's&mdash;oh, but what's the
use! There isn't anybody in the world like Ambo."</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>More than a year has already passed since those dark-bright
days, the spring of 1918. Down here in quiet, silvery
Provence, at our nursing-home for children&mdash;I call
it ours&mdash;the last of the cherry blossoms are falling now in
our walled orchard close. As I write, James Aulard Kane
sits&mdash;none too steadily&mdash;among a snow of petals, and
sweeps them together in miniature drifts with two very
grubby little hands. He is a likely infant and knows definitely
what he wants from life, which is mostly food. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
talks nothing but French&mdash;that is, he emits the usual baby
grunts and snortings in a funny harsh accent caught from
his Marseillaise nurse. Susan is far too busy to improve
this accent as she would like to do: perhaps it would be
simpler to say that she is far too busy. She is the queen-bee
of this country hive; and I&mdash;I am a harmless enough drone.
They let me dawdle about here and do this and that; but
the sun grows more powerful daily, and I sleep a good deal
now through the warmer hours. I am haunted by fewer
mysterious twinges, here and there, when I sleep.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the world-cauldron bubbles, and the bubbles
keep bursting, and I read of their bursting and shake
my head. When a man begins shaking his head over the
news of the day, he is done for; a back number. Susan
never shakes her head; and it's rather hard on her, I think,
to be the wife of a back number. But she's far too thoughtful
of me ever to seem to mind.</p>

<p>Only yesterday I quoted some lines to her, from Coventry
Patmore. Susan doesn't like Coventry Patmore; the
mystical Unknown Eros he celebrates strikes her as&mdash;well,
perhaps I had better not go into that. But the lines I
quoted&mdash;they had been much in my mind lately&mdash;were
these:</p>

<div class='poem'>
<i>For want of me the world's course will not fail;</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>When all its work is done the lie shall rot;</i></span><br />
<i>The truth is great and shall prevail</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>When none cares whether it prevail or not.</i></span><br />
</div>

<p>"Stuff! We do care!" said Susan. "And it won't prevail,
